    "title": "Navigating the UK Graduate Visa Process: A PhD Graduate’s Experience",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I recently finished my PhD (yay!) and went through the process of applying for a UK Graduate Visa. Although I had a job offer lined up, I chose the Graduate Visa route instead of a standard Work Visa. In this blog post, I’ll explain my motivations for this decision and give an overview of the process.\nThe UK Graduate Visa is a type of visa that allows international students who have completed a degree programme in the UK to stay in the country for a longer period after graduation. The visa provides the opportunity to work and settle in the UK. When I completed my Bachelor’s at Cardiff University in 2015, there were limited options to remain in the country and limited benefits for having graduated from a UK university.\nThankfully this has changed somewhat with the introduction of the Graduate Visa.\nAt the time, the best option was the standard Tier 2 Skilled Worker visa. By applying for this visa from a student visa, my employer and I were able to bypass some standard work checks and I was exempt from salary requirements. However, when I was granted this visa in 2015, it was only valid for a year. When I was offered a new job with a different company, I was required to apply for a new work visa, this time subject to all the requirements.\nThis became a problem when the new job did not meet the increased salary requirements and my visa application was denied. Despite having lived in the UK for four years, earned a BSc in Physics & Music, and being actively recruited for the job, I was forced to leave the country and return to the US.\nWhen I completed my PhD and was offered a Research Fellowship at UCL, I had to decide between applying for a Skilled Worker visa or a Graduate visa. Given my previous experience with work visas, I chose the Graduate visa. Unlike the Skilled Worker visa, the Graduate visa allows PhD graduates to remain in the UK with minimal restrictions for three years, without having to reapply each time they take on a new contract or change jobs.\nHowever, there were some challenges I faced when applying for the Graduate visa. Firstly, I had to pay for the visa myself, as my prospective employer would not cover the cost for the Graduate visa since I was no longer guaranteed to work for them. Secondly, the timeline for applying for the visa was difficult; you cannot apply for the visa until you have completed everything and been awarded your degree - this means passing the viva, submitting corrections, and having those corrections approved by your examiners. From thesis submission to completion can take anywhere from 3 months to a year and a half. And this is all assuming you submit on time!\nDespite these challenges, my experience with the Graduate visa application was relatively smooth, and it was a more straightforward process compared to the Student visa or the Work visa. Although there was still some stress and uncertainty, I didn’t encounter any major issues and I was able to successfully obtain the visa."

    "section": "My Graduate Visa timeline",
    "text": "My Graduate Visa timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome parts of this process may be specific to UCL, however the general outline should be universal. The fact that UCL lists your official completion date as the 28th of whatever month you fulfilled all of the requirements is probably specific to UCL, but there may be similar policies at other unis. I think it’s important to be aware of this sort of thing (which no one ever tells you about) especially if you’re working to potentially tight timelines.\n\n\nTo help give a concrete example for people of what this timeline looks like, I’ve laid out the exact dates for each step of my process. My Student Visa was set to expire in January of the next year, so I planned out the timeline preparing for lots of delays and issues to make sure my right to stay and work wouldn’t be in jeopardy.\n\n[June 06] - Thesis submission\n[Sept 08] - Viva\n[Sept 09] - Receive report and corrections from examiners\n[Sept 26] - Submit my corrections to examiners\n[Sept 30] - Examiners confirm their acceptance via email to me and formally inform UCL. (I had very responsive examiners and minimal corrections so this was quite fast)\n[Sept 30] - UCL sends email confirming they received the notification from examiners and instructed my to upload an electronic copy of the thesis.\n[Oct 03] - UCL sends confirmation of results email. This confirms all of the details of my degree: Name, programme, start date, end date, etc. Importantly, the official date of the award is the 28th of the month you fulfill all of the requirements (i.e. upload the electronic copy). For me, even though I uploaded on the 30th, they back dated it to the 28th of September. If I had finished everything on the 1st October, my official award date would have been 28th October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nVery important note: you cannot submit your visa application until the University informs the Home Office you have completed your degree. This is not the same as them sending your certificate to you. This is a separate process and should be automatically done directly from the University to the Home Office.\n\n\n\n[Oct 19] - Confirmation that UCL has informed the Home Office about my degree. Now I can submit the visa application. I think if my official date had been delayed to October 28th, I wouldn’t have been able to submit my visa application until after that date.\n[Oct 19] - Submit visa application and pay application fees and immigration health surcharge.\n[Nov 22] - Visa granted.\n\nIf you were fully funded (100% tuition and stipend) during your PhD, you will need to provide evidence from your funder that they consent to your Graduate Visa application. The reason for this requirement is unclear, but it is important to note. If you were not fully funded, you may not need to provide this consent, but it is still a good idea to be prepared in case it is required. To ease my worries, my supervisor, who was the principal investigator on my funding grant, and I drafted a letter addressing this issue. Although the Home Office did not mention it, it is always better to be safe than sorry.\nThis information is intended to give you an idea of what the application process looks like. Please note that the experience may vary from person to person. For example, my submission, viva, and correction process was quick and straightforward, which may not be the case for everyone.\nIn conclusion, the UK Graduate Visa provides an attractive option for international PhD graduates looking to stay in the UK and further their careers. While there may be some challenges in the application process, especially for those who were fully funded during their PhD studies, the benefits of not having to reapply for a work visa every time you change jobs and the freedom to change careers make it a worthwhile option to consider. Overall, my experience with the Graduate Visa application was positive and I hope this article provides some helpful insight for those who may be considering it in the future."

In this episode, we delve into the critical issue of noise pollution and explore how soundscape engineering can be a powerful tool in mitigating its impact on our health and environment.\nHere’s a sneak peek into my contribution:\n\nSoundscape Engineering: As an advocate for sustainable solutions, I discussed the fascinating field of soundscape engineering. This innovative discipline focuses on taking a holistic approach to shaping the acoustic environment to enhance well-being, reduce noise-related stress, and create harmonious spaces. From urban planning to architectural design, soundscape engineering will play a pivotal role in creating healthier cities in the future.\nUCL Soundscape Lab: During the podcast, I shared insights from the Soundscape Lab at University College London (UCL). This cutting-edge research facility is at the forefront of unraveling the complexities of soundscapes. We explored how advanced modeling techniques help us understand noise patterns, identify sources, and design interventions that promote tranquility.\n\nI invite you to listen to the full episode on the “Mission: Responsible” podcast, where we dive deep into the intersection of technology, responsibility, and environmental well-being.

    "title": "Questions on predictive soundscape modelling",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Do you think there is reasonable validity in lab-based soundscape evaluation?\nDepending on the quality of the lab presentation, yes. Virtual Reality systems, either with ambisonic playback or with head-tracked binaural, along with a head mounted display appear to achieve at least acceptable levels of ecological validity (see work from my colleague Chunyang Xu). This should also be considered with how useful lab-based evaluation can be for research. There’s so much we can do experimentally in a lab that is impossible in situ. This includes physiological/neurological measurements, testing the addition of new sounds in a complex scene, investigating the influence of the direction a sound comes from, and mixing and matching visual and auditory stimuli (what happens when the sound scene so clearly doesn’t match the visual environment?). But of course, this is balanced by things which are only possible in situ and not in a lab – sampling the population which actually uses a space, incorporating the participants’ purpose for being there and their relationship to the space, etc. So it depends a lot on what your research question is – for true ecological validity, for engagement with the space, for monumental and historical spaces, in situ is probably still best. For things which can’t be done in situ or a to have more controlled experimental setup – in the lab.\nWhat I think is clear (to me at least) is that over-the-internet evaluations are almost certainly not valid for perceptual assessments. It’s very difficult to know exactly what the respondent was exposed to. The lack of control in playback loudness and quality, the static audio rather than headtracked, and usually the lack of a head mounted display all limit what we can do with it. We’ve had some success using online surveys for sound source identification, but we actually ended up throwing out a whole load of perceptual attribute data we collected this way during COVID because we felt it wasn’t valid.\nYour example of retirees having different attitudes to the rest of the population is a good example.\nInterestingly, multi-level modelling was the analysis we used to find that particular result!\nThis brings into question the truth of the quality of a soundscape given these differing attitudes and opinions; if you are engineering a soundscape for quality, how do you maximise soundscape quality given this difference? How representative is the survey population per group (retirees/students/workers etc), and does this influence the generalisability of your model?\nWhile there are significant effects of these sorts of demographic questions, like that of retirees, they are still relatively small, accounting for about 1.4% of the variance for Pleasantness ratings and 3.9% for Eventfulness ratings. That shouldn’t be ignored, but the sort of predictive modelling we’re talking about isn’t yet at the point where we can approach that level of accuracy. I suspect that the inherent randomness and degree of variance for any individual’s response is such that we may never get there, for these sorts of models. Particularly for in situ surveys, we’re dealing with quite noisy data where the noise is inherent due to every individual’s randomness in their response.\nBut this gets to my next point, which hopefully I’ll be publishing on soon – we need to think of soundscape assessments in statistical and probabilistic terms. For real-world assessments, I don’t think it’s at all useful and is in fact probably irresponsible, to talk about predicting the response of any individual, or a single predicted response to a single input. Our modelling should ideally incorporate the inherent randomness of people’s responses, such that any single input (i.e. a recording or sound sample) gives a range of predicted responses, since that is how it works in reality. Even with perfect information – i.e. we know exactly the sound you’re exposed to and your noise sensitivity and we know your demographic information and what you had for breakfast this morning – there would still be some random range of responses you could give. This range would likely have a normal shape and have tendencies and we could predict how that distribution would move, but it’s pointless to try to say there is some ground truth of what you will perceive for a given input – human perception is a chaotic system. When we scale this up to locations and populations of people, we should be saying things like “70% of people would likely find this space vibrant”.\nNow, how we maximise soundscape quality is a different question to predicting assessments. To me, this is a designer’s task in a lot of cases. Which is the ideal soundscape, a vibrant one, or a calm one? It depends on the context, and there’s no single number or descriptor that says ‘this is the best soundscape’. The designers (including acoustic and soundscape experts) need to decide on their desired type of soundscape, in consultation with the users and other stakeholders. Then we can help predict what changes will lead to this desired soundscape outcome.\nI wanted to ask how deep you went into your nonlinear modelling strategies, and did they highlight anything that is not represented by your multilevel linear model?\nThe non-linear work was done by a Masters student I supervised and was mostly exploratory. We tried several non-linear methods and saw some differences among them, but none of them achieved the performance of the MLM I presented. At the moment I’m not completely sure why this is, but I suspect it’s down to the care that was put into the structure of the MLM. It’s the culmination of three years of PhD work, compared to less than a year afforded to the Masters work. The nonlinear work was meant as a sanity check to make sure there wasn’t some obvious advantage to non-linear models that would blow the linear one out of the water. There are some other reasons behind this approach, but mostly I came into the work from an engineering consulting perspective and one of the requirements I placed on my model was to be transparent and interpretable so that engineers could dig through it and understand what was causing e.g. a soundscape to be chaotic. This immediately excluded things like neural networks and to some extent SVMs and random forests from my personal research. The hope was for some other researchers to explore a non-linear approach (specifically neural networks) from the start but unfortunately this fell through.\nI’m hoping to 1. Incorporate nonlinear transformations of input features into future linear models, and 2. Further investigate non-linear models.\nHowever, I wonder if they mask the insufficiency of linear regressions in modelling piecewise and nonlinear features that appear in soundscape evaluation.\nI’m not convinced this is insurmountable in a linear regression. For me the next step to identifying this is to look at the wide array of features we could include and calculated non-linear correlations (personally, I’m looking at mutual information and conditional mutual information). This can help us identify whether there is any relationship, linear, piecewise, or otherwise, between the input feature and the output evaluation. Once that has been narrowed down and identified, we can do a non linear transformation before feeding into the linear model or just define separate regimes for the linear model (e.g. one set of coefficients for below 65 dBA, and one set for above). I think this is very likely, since several pieces of research have seemed to identify some threshold (somewhere around 65-70 dBA) above which the sound level is in fact dominant in a classical environmental acoustics/annoyance manner. I think we’ll need to define different approaches for the different regimes.\nDid you have to perform any further preprocessing of your data before feeding your nonlinear models?\nFor this specific work, I’d say no. We have a data cleaning process, all features are standardized before feature selection, and we used either a train/test split or cross validation for feature selection and model building, but not any true pre-processing. As above, this will probably change as we try to make sure we haven’t missed any nonlinearities.\nHave you explored methods for feature generation that are not manually engineered i.e. not traditional psychoacoustic indices?\nYes and no. For yes, I’ve been exploring a new metric for characterising temporal behaviour (based on the 1/f behaviour explored here), but it is derived from the time series of the psychoacoustic indices themselves. For no, again, this was a limitation I imposed from the start to my particular work. I wanted to make use of the vast psychoacoustic research which has not made its way into environmental acoustics before, and I wanted to make sure the metrics used were understandable by the engineers who would likely use the models. If we instead used for example MFCCs, it’s very difficult to interpret what is actually influencing the outcome of the model. Great, you have a super accurate ANN based on MFCCs, now what? How do you identify what is causing the problem in your soundscape? How do you design a mitigation strategy if you can’t even identify what the problem is? How do you identify what is working well to enhance or apply elsewhere if you’re working with a black box?\nThat’s a bit facetious, but I do think there is serious value in a transparent and interpretable model with understandable inputs. That said, I’m not entirely opposed to techniques like that and am using them for some other work on sound source recognition.\nDo you plan to test the generalisability of your model to soundscapes not in your dataset?\nThe specific model I presented, no. It is not generalisable to other locations due to the way the MLM was set up. The next step is to replace that categorical variable which identifies the locationID with some combination of characteristics which describe the location – architectural typology, visual openness, greenness, etc. With this, it could then be applied to other locations. So a model trained on this dataset will eventually be generalisable and will be tested on other locations, just not the one we currently have.\nI wanted to ask if you had an intuition for the validity of the different psychoacoustic metrics that you ended up with in your model for eventfulness?\nIt’s like you’ve read my mind! Here’s a section I wrote a few months ago on the use of psychoacoustic metrics in soundscape for my thesis:\n“From the experience of the previous studies which are highly focussed on the existing environmental acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics, one (of many) potential limitations has been revealed. For the most part, these metrics were designed to characterise various negative qualities of the sound. Certainly, they therefore have a valid negative correlation with positive assessments of the sound, but the simple fact is that they were conceived of and implemented in an attempt to quantify some sonic characteristic that was assumed by the researchers to contribute to a negative perception. Hence why in Zwicker’s empirical formula for Psychoacoustic Annoyance, all of the constituent parts have positive coefficients.\nWhile this would not theoretically hinder a formula for describing positive aspects of the sound, it creates a sort of conceptual barrier. If all of these metrics are designed to capture negative aspects of the sound, then it is insufficient to use them to create a formula to describe a positive sound, since that formula would only represent the ‘absence of negativity’, not necessarily positivity.”\nI understand that eventfulness might be an attribute that is very local to the specific soundscape experience being surveyed at the time; if this is the case, what is the intuition for fluctuation strength being a factor in eventfulness?\nOn the contrary, the feature reduction of our model showed that the context (at least due to the location) is not important for Eventfulness, while it is highly important for Pleasantness. Therefore eventfulness is less local to the specific soundscape experience and is much more dependent on the acoustic features, regardless of the rest of the context.\nI see LAeq is still the strongest influence in your model of eventfulness, given this, I am interested to know why loudness isn’t in this list of predictors.\nThis is primarily down to the feature selection process we used, which prioritised model performance. Given the slate of other features which were initially considered, it’s conceivable that LAeq was providing information which Loudness didn’t, when taken in context with the other psychoacoustical metrics and therefore Loudness was removed. We wouldn’t expect both features to be included in the final model anyway and, in fact, we would have manually removed one if necessary to prevent collinearity. Since LAeq and Loudness encode similar (but not identical) information, they are highly correlated but will behave somewhat differently within the model and the feature selection. That said, this process is somewhat brittle, meaning with a slightly different sample, Loudness may have won out in place of LAeq. The overall structure and behaviour of the model is robust, but given two highly correlated metrics, it’s a bit of a toss up which one was ultimately selected. I would discourage anyone from making declarative statements like ‘LAeq is the important one, ditch Loudness’ on the basis of this model.\nOn the same note, do you think annotations of the number of discrete acoustic events that occured during a recording might be an effective indicator of eventfulness (assuming you could compute the number of discrete events, either computationally or manually); I guess I am asking if you think eventfulness is purely based on the number of events that occured or if eventfulness is motivated by many other factors.\nI absolutely think that’s a great point. Something like the number of LAmax events above a certain value (which I think is used in sleep disturbance?) would probably be a good candidate metric to include. I’ll put it on the list! Alternatively, if a system for counting the discrete sound events could be made, maybe using environmental sound recognition, that would also be great.\nThat said, I think it would again be one of many features in the final model. I don’t think there’s any single metric which can describe the complex perceptual attributes we’re aiming for. Again, I’ll just quote a section I wrote a bit ago:\n“Contrary to the hopes expressed by Aletta et al. (2014), that”ideally there should be one acous- tic indicator per dimension”, the evidence from subsequent investigations and modelling at- tempts (Lionello et al., 2020) indicates this to be unlikely. There appears to be no reason we should think the perceptual dimensions should be reduced to a single acoustic indicator. The dimensions of soundscape represent complex perceptual concepts which we should expect to be composed of a multi-factor interaction between the input features. This necessary complexity highlights the need for a more sophisticated machine learning approach in order to handle and interpret the interactions between the many input features which contribute to the formation of a soundscape perception. (Aletta et al., 2016)”\nPersonally, I think the next big step will be to integrate a sound source recognition model along into a psychoacoustic and contextual model of soundscape to really tease out how the perceptual response is dependent on the acoustic characteristics, combined with the meaning assigned to the sound source, and mediated by the context and personal factors.\nHow co-compatible do you think pleasantness and vibrancy are with valence and arousal?\nFor my purposes, pleasantness and eventfulness are just the specific labels for the concept of soundscape valence and arousal, which is how Axelsson presented it originally. So technically they are exactly compatible, since pleasantness is just soundscape valence and eventfulness is just soundscape arousal. I think Axelsson’s work, Simone Torresin’s work on the indoor soundscape circumplex, and our own upcoming work on translating the perceptual attributes, all agree enough to demonstrate that the framework of the soundscape circumplex is solid enough to build on, although there are still some particularities to work out, particularly with the precise labels used for the various attributes.\nHave you performed any dimensionality reduction in the process of evaluating the data, to see which dimensions in the data are co-linear and orthogonal?\nNot formally yet (at least not beyond some simple exploratory correlation analyses), but that’ll be coming…\nDo you plan to have participants evaluate your lockdown recordings in-the-lab, to get an idea of the validity of either your model or how participants might rate your soundscapes in a lab setting?\nI probably won’t end up doing that work, but yeah I think someone from our lab is planning on it. We were definitely planning on doing a round of validation work comparing in situ vs lab responses with our recordings, it’s just a matter of lab time, workload, and competing with other good ideas.\nFinally, I wanted to ask if you were planning to publish any of the audio and higher resolution 360 still images from your database?\nI am interested in using the recordings in my own research (with the necessary citations, correspondence and invitation to collaborate of course).\nGreat to hear! Yes, we are working on this! We released the data used for the lockdown modelling study for open access on Zenodo as the ‘International Soundscape Database’. But this just includes the survey results and the output of the psychoacoustic analysis at this early stage. I’m now working on organising the binaural recordings to make them openly available as part of a future version of the database.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

Well, they solve two important challenges with clustering: visualisation and determining the optimal number of clusters.\nIn general, cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning task, meaning we don’t predefine a target output for the learning. For clustering, this mainly means that we don’t know what the categories will be before we start the analysis. We also don’t know how many clusters are present.\nMany indices have been created to help with determining the optimal number of clusters, however these each have their own advantages and disadvantages and often give conflicting results. We’ll demonstrate this by looking at the results from three popular graphical methods: elbow plot, silhouette, and gap statistic."

Well, they solve two important challenges with clustering: visualisation and determining the optimal number of clusters.\nIn general, cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning task, meaning we don’t predefine a target output for the learning. For clustering, this mainly means that we don’t know what the categories will be before we start the analysis. We also don’t know how many clusters are present.\nMany indices have been created to help with determining the optimal number of clusters, however these each have their own advantages and disadvantages and often give conflicting results. We’ll demonstrate this by looking at the results from three popular graphical methods: elbow plot, silhouette, and gap statistic."

This dataset contains data in-situ perceptual assessments of urban soundscapes, paired with acoustic and environmental data. For this set, we’ll be looking at the perceptual data only.\nTo collect the data, random members of the public were approached while in urban public spaces and asked to take a survey about how they perceive the sound environment. A section of the questions ask specifically about the perceived dominance of sound sources in the space. Sound sources are categorized as Traffic noise, Other noise, Human sounds, Natural sounds, and are rated from 1 [not at all] to 5 [dominates completely].\nThe data was collected across 27 locations in the UK, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and China. The goal here is to investigate whether these locations can be categorized based on their composition of sound sources.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)  # Data processing and piping\n\n# Clustering libraries\nlibrary(factoextra) # Clustering and visualisation\nlibrary(NbClust)    # Optimal Number of Clusters\nlibrary(RCurl)      # For downloading data from Zenodo\n\ntemp.file &lt;- paste0(tempfile(), \".xlsx\")\ndownload.file(\"https://zenodo.org/record/5705908/files/SSID%20Lockdown%20Database%20VL0.2.2.xlsx\", temp.file, mode=\"wb\")\nssid.data &lt;- read_excel(temp.file)\n\nvars &lt;- c(\"Traffic\", \"Other\", \"Natural\", \"Human\")\n# vars &lt;- c(\"pleasant\", \"chaotic\", \"vibrant\", \"uneventful\", \"calm\", \"annoying\", \"eventful\", \"monotonous\")\n\n# Cutdown the dataset\nssid.data &lt;- ssid.data[c(\"GroupID\", \"SessionID\", \"LocationID\", vars)]\n\n# ssid.data &lt;- subset(ssid.data, Lockdown != 1)\n\n# Set GroupID, SessionID, Location as factor type\nssid.data &lt;- ssid.data %&gt;% mutate_at(vars(GroupID, SessionID, LocationID),\n                                     funs(as.factor))\nssid.data &lt;- ssid.data %&gt;% mutate_at(vars(vars),\n                                     funs(as.numeric))\n\n# Calculate the mean response for each GroupID\nssid.data &lt;- ssid.data %&gt;% \n    group_by(GroupID) %&gt;%\n    summarize(\n              Traffic = mean(Traffic, na.rm=TRUE),\n              Other = mean(Other, na.rm=TRUE),\n              Natural = mean(Natural, na.rm=TRUE),\n              Human = mean(Human, na.rm=TRUE),\n              # pleasant = mean(pleasant, na.rm = TRUE),\n              # chaotic = mean(chaotic, na.rm = TRUE),\n              # vibrant = mean(vibrant, na.rm = TRUE),\n              # uneventful = mean(uneventful, na.rm = TRUE),\n              # calm = mean(calm, na.rm = TRUE),\n              # annoying = mean(annoying, na.rm = TRUE),\n              # eventful = mean(eventful, na.rm = TRUE),\n              # monotonous = mean(monotonous, na.rm = TRUE),\n              LocationID = LocationID[1])\n\n# analysis.data$LocationID &lt;- unique(ssid.data[c('GroupID', 'LocationID')])['LocationID']\nssid.data &lt;- na.omit(ssid.data)\n\nknitr::kable(head(ssid.data))\n\n\n\n\n\nGroupID\nTraffic\nOther\nNatural\nHuman\nLocationID\n\n\n\n\nAM01\n1\n3.0\n1.0\n4.000000\nSanMarco\n\n\nAM02\n2\n1.5\n3.5\n4.000000\nSanMarco\n\n\nAM03\n1\n1.0\n2.0\n4.666667\nSanMarco\n\n\nAM05\n2\n2.0\n3.0\n1.000000\nSanMarco\n\n\nAM06\n1\n4.0\n1.5\n3.500000\nSanMarco\n\n\nAM07\n1\n1.0\n4.0\n4.000000\nSanMarco\n\n\n\n\n\nOur locations are:\n\n\nCode\nprint(levels(ssid.data$LocationID))\n\n\n [1] \"CamdenTown\"         \"EustonTap\"          \"MarchmontGarden\"   \n [4] \"MonumentoGaribaldi\" \"PancrasLock\"        \"RegentsParkFields\" \n [7] \"RegentsParkJapan\"   \"RussellSq\"          \"SanMarco\"          \n[10] \"StPaulsCross\"       \"StPaulsRow\"         \"TateModern\"        \n[13] \"TorringtonSq\""

This data all then gets gathered up, collated and databased, and analysed as part of our ongoing soundscape research.\nThe whole timeline of this protocol is shown in this figure:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Timeline of the on site soundscape protocol.

    "section": "2 Defining what a predictive soundscape model is",
    "text": "2 Defining what a predictive soundscape model is\nAletta, Kang, and Axelsson (2016) provide a review of the soundscape descriptors and indicators commonly used in soundscape research and outlines an initial framework for developing predictive soundscape models. In their review, the authors identified eight potential soundscape descriptors, including perceived affective quality (Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2010), restorativeness (Payne 2013), etc. Similarly, the authors identified a range of potential indicators used to characterise the acoustic environment, including environmental acoustics indicators such as L_{Aeq}, L_{Ceq} − L_{Aeq} and psychoacoustic indicators such as Loudness (N_5) and Sharpness (S).\nHowever, it is noted that several studies show that no single psychoacoustic indicator alone can explain the variation in soundscape responses (as expressed via the descriptors) (e.g. (Persson Waye and Öhrström 2002)). The goal of statistical modelling, therefore is to create a more complex and complete representation of the relationship between soundscape indicators and descriptors, beyond what any single indicator could achieve.\nFigure 1 shows a conceptual view of this relationship. We start with soundscape indicators, which characterise the physical and contextual environment to which the listener is exposed. This can be broken down into sonic features (e.g. the acoustical features listed above) and characteristics of the space itself (e.g. the amount of visible sky, the intended use-case of the space, how crowded the space is, etc.). In order to translate from the physical inputs to an expressed description of the soundscape perception, we introduce the concept of a perceptual mapping (Lionello 2021). This mapping represents a simplified idea of how each individual’s brain processes the inputs from the soundscape which they experience, forms a perception, and finally expresses that perception through their description of the soundscape. For our purposes, this perceptual mapping is treated as essentially a black box mapping inputs to outputs. It can be conceived of as a network of weights in which certain characteristics of the sound may have different weights and directions depending on the context, through which all of the inputs are processed, resulting in the soundscape rating. Conceptually, this perceptual mapping – the pathways and weightings through which the inputs are processed before being expressed as a perceptual descriptor – is established prior to an individual’s exposure to the soundscape in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The conceptual model of soundscape perception, illustrating the perceptual mapping from physical inputs, through personal experience, to soundscape descriptors. The role of the statistical model is to attempt to approximate or reflect this perceptual mappint. Reproduced with permission from Mitchell (2022)\n\n\n\nIt should be made clear that this represents a very simplified view of how a soundscape perception is formed, however it provides a useful conceptual framework for the purposes of understanding and modelling how someone’s perception forms in response to their exposure to a space. One way to consider the function of a statistical model of soundscape perception is as replicating the perceptual mapping between soundscape indicators and descriptors (Lionello 2021). As a person experiences an urban space, they are exposed to an array of physical inputs, these are then processed by the listener through their own personal experience and mapped to their perception of that space. This perception is then expressed through their description of this experience of the soundscape. It is this mapping of physical inputs to perceptual description which the statistical model aims to reflect. The most successful model would then accurately replicate the general perceptual mapping across the population."

    "section": "3 Applications in design and mapping",
    "text": "3 Applications in design and mapping\nThe soundscape approach faces several challenges in practical applications which are unaddressed by current assessment methods, but which may be solved through the development of a predictive modelling framework. The first of these challenges is predicting how a change in an existing sound environment will be reflected in the soundscape perception. While it is possible in this scenario to measure the existing soundscape perception via questionnaire surveys, if a change is then introduced to the acoustic environment, it is so far impossible to say what the resulting soundscape change would be. This question relates strongly to the idea of soundscape interventions; where a particular noise pollution challenge is addressed by introducing more pleasant sounds (e.g. a water feature), following the soundscape principle of treating sound as a resource (Lavia et al. 2016; Moshona et al. 2022). Predicting how much a particular intervention would improve the soundscape (or, indeed whether it would improve at all) is not yet possible with the retrospective methods available.\nSeveral studies have attempted to address this gap by developing machine learning or statistical models of soundscape perception which are focussed on prediction, rather than inference. An array of modelling techniques are used, with linear regression being the most common (Lionello, Aletta, and Kang 2020), and also including artificial neural networks (ANN) (Puyana Romero et al. 2016; Yu and Kang 2009) and support vector regression (SVR) (Fan, Thorogood, and Pasquier 2016, 2017; Giannakopoulos, Orfanidi, and Perantonis 2019). However, these studies have focussed primarily on using these models to investigate the constructs of soundscape perception, with few efforts to put the models themselves to use. Mitchell et al. (2021) attempted to address this by both developing a predictive model and applying it to an applied scenario where traditional assessment methods were impractical. In a unique application, Ooi et al. (2022) created a predictive model of soundscape pleasantness which fed an automated and reactive soundscape enhancement system (Watcharasupat et al. 2022).\nRetrospective methods also struggle to capture the dynamics of the soundscape in a space. Whether through the narrative interview method of ISO/TS 12913-2 (ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 2018), through soundwalks, or through in situ questionnaires (Mitchell et al. 2020), only the soundscape during the particular period which the researchers are actively investigating is captured. This makes it very difficult to determine diurnal, seasonal, or yearly patterns of the soundscape. These patterns may be driven by corresponding diurnal, seasonal, or yearly patterns in the acoustic or visual environment, or by variations in how people process and respond to the sound at different times of day/season/year. Currently the only way to investigate any of these patterns is through repeated surveys. Predictive modelling, on the other hand, could allow a trained soundscape model to be paired with longterm monitoring methods to track how a soundscape perception may change in response to changes in the acoustic environment.\nSimilarly, a move towards modelling methods based on objective and/or measurable factors would facilitate the application of mapping in soundscape. While noise maps have become common in urban noise research and legislation (EEA 2020; Gasco et al. 2020), they can be difficult to translate into a soundscape approach. The Environmental Noise Directive (END) (European Union 2002), first implemented in 2002, is the main EU instrument to identify noise pollution impacts and track urban noise levels across the EU. Its goals were to determine the population’s exposure to environmental noise, make information on environmental noise available to the public, and prevent and reduce environmental noise and its effects. In general, noise maps are based on modelled traffic flows, from which decibel levels are extrapolated and mapped, although interpolation and mobile measurement methods have also been recently developed (see Aumond, Jacquesson, and Can 2018). Alternatively, they can be produced using longterm SLMs or sensor networks. While these methods have significant utility for tracking increases in urban noise levels and are important for determining the health and societal impacts of noise on a large scale, their restricted focus on noise levels alone limits their scope and reduces the potential for identifying more nuanced health and psychological effects of urban sound.\nSeveral studies have attempted to bring soundscape to urban noise mapping. The most notable of these attempts (Aumond, Jacquesson, and Can 2018; Aletta and Kang 2015; Hong and Jeon 2017; Kang and Aletta 2018) bring new, more sophisticated methods for mapping urban sound (not just noise levels). For instance, all four present methods which map the relative level of various sound sources, producing maps of the spatial distribution of bird sounds, human voices, water sounds, etc. In Aletta and Kang (2015) and Hong and Jeon (2017) the mapping relied on soundscape surveys conducted in public spaces, then used interpolation methods and basic relationships to the measured noise levels to generate a map of the perceived soundscape over the entire study space. Kang et al. (2018), after starting with survey responses, attempted to create a prediction methods which relied only on the audio recordings made in the space to create visual maps of the predicted soundscape perception (i.e. the perceptual attributes ’pleasant’, ’calm’, ’eventful’, ’annoying’, ’chaotic’, ’monotonous’). According to the authors, the prediction and mapping model would follow three steps: (1) sound sources recognition and profiling, (2) prediction of the soundscape’s perceptual attributes, and (3) implementation of soundscape maps. Unfortunately, from the paper, it appears that the prediction model results were not actually used for the mapping and, again, the survey responses from 21 respondents were interpolated to create the soundscape map. Their results indicated how a predictive model could have been slotted into a mapping use-case, but this was limited by (1) the relatively poor predictive performance for several of the attributes, (2) the inability to automatically recognise sound sources, and (3) a very limited dataset in terms of sample size and variety of locations.\nWhile the connection is not made to perception, Aumond, Jacquesson, and Can (2018) focussed on creating sound maps which can reflect the pattern of sound source emergences over time within a city. By stochastically activating varying sound sources across their map, they could map the percentage of time when a sound source emerges from the overall complex sound environment. If a predictive soundscape model which incorporates sound source information can be developed, then the same procedure which led to their sound source emergence maps could also feed the soundscape model, resulting in a map of predicted perception over time.\nUrban scale noise mapping and its implementation at the international level has been crucial in highlighting the health impacts of urban noise and in providing evidence for the negative cost of excess noise. Traffic flow models of noise, large community noise surveys, and policy requirements to track noise levels have all been necessary to reveal these impacts. By creating predictive soundscape models, combined with new tools and sensing capabilities from smart city efforts, we can bring soundscape into these same realms. Without this, these large-scale impact studies will be limited to valuing the negative cost of urban noise, missing the potential value of positive soundscapes. By bringing perception-based practice to the same scale and type of evidence, we can expand urban sound research to consider a holistic view of urban spaces and their impacts.\nThe broader use-case and need for such soundscape models and maps was recently highlighted by Jiang et al. (2022), which opens the discussion for how the value and impact of soundscapes should be measured and what tools are needed to enable the valuation of policy interventions for soundscapes. In response to Question 5, “What soundscape metrics and data will be needed?”, the authors make clear the necessity of predictive soundscape models: “Quantitative soundscape metrics that link subjective perceptions to objective acoustic and contextual factors will be needed, to enable monetisation while at the same time account for the perception-based nature of soundscape.” In addition, the authors make a strong case for the need for soundscape indices: “Despite the varied requirements for soundscape metrics and data between and even within valuation methods, a standardised metric or set of metrics, such as dB in noise valuation [. . . ] will allow comparison and integration of different studies and building compatible evidence bases.”"

    "section": "4 The Predictive Soundscape Model Framework",
    "text": "4 The Predictive Soundscape Model Framework\nSeveral forms and iterations of predictive models have been developed (Lionello, Aletta, and Kang 2020) and more recently they have been put to use in real-world use cases (Mitchell et al. 2021; Watcharasupat et al. 2022). To improve on these models and make them into a useful engineering tool, we should establish a framework of overarching goals for models to achieve and the resulting development constraints. In general, the goals we define are related to how we might wish for models to be used and deployed, while the constraints are practical limitations which may make the performance of a given model less than ideal, but are necessary to achieve the deployment goals.\n\n4.1 Goals\nBefore defining what form a general practical predictive model should take, we first need to make clear what the goals of such a model are, as derived from the preceding discussion laying out why predictive models are needed in soundscape.\nAccuracy – First, that it to a reasonable extent is successful in predicting the collective perception (see Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang 2022) of a soundscape. It should succeed at both indicating the central tendency of the soundscape perception, but importantly it should also inform the likely spread of perception among the population. The outcome of the predictive model should not be focussed on predicting an individual assessment; the goal is not the predict the perception of any specific individual, but to reflect the public’s perception of a public space. In other words, ideally the model will result in an accurate distribution of soundscape perceptions for the target population.\nAutomation – Second, that it can be implemented automatically. Once an initial setup is performed, such as identifying what location the measurements are conducted in, the model should be capable of moving from recorded information to predicted soundscape distribution without human intervention. We need soundscape assessments to be able to be performed instrumentally. This enables it to be applied to unmanned uses, such as smart city sensors and soundscape mapping. It is impractical to conduct soundscape surveys or soundwalks in every location we wish to map and certainly not when we wish to see how these locations change over longer periods of time. A predictive model should allow us to survey these soundscapes remotely in order to extend soundscape to city-scale assessments.\nComparisons – Third, the model should enable us to test, score, and compare proposed interventions. In a design context, it is crucial that various strategies and interventions can be tested and that the influencing factors can be identified. The model should assist the user in highlighting what factor is limiting the success of a soundscape, spark ideas for how to address it, and allow these ideas to be tested. Several other useful features of predictive soundscape models arise out of these goals and will be discussed later, but these form the core goals of the framework.\n\n\n4.2 Constraints\nIf we accept that predictive models are necessary to advance a more holistic approach to urban sound in smart cities, we must then define the constraints of such a model. The goal here is to define a framework for what is needed from a future model intended to be used in a smart city sensors, soundscape mapping, or urban design context.\nInputs – The first constraint is that the model must be based on measurable factors. By this, we mean that the data which eventually feeds into the predictive model should be collected via sensor measurements of one sort or another; this could be acoustic sound level measurements or recordings, environmental measurements, video recordings, or GIS measurements, etc. What it certainly cannot include is perceptual data. This is strictly a practical constraint – for a predictive model designed to be used in practice, there is no justification to include other perceptual factors, such as perceived greenness, derived from surveys but not whichever factor you desire to predict. If the goal is to predict soundscape pleasantness and it is necessary to survey people about the visual pleasantness, why not just also survey them about the soundscape pleasantness directly? Certainly this mix of perceptual data is useful in research and can elucidate the relationship between the sonic and visual environments, but it is not useful in a practical predictive context. Any results which arise from research combining this sort of perceptual information must eventually be translated into a component which can itself be measured or modelled.\nCalculation – The second constraint is that any analysis of the measured data can be done automatically, without human intervention. If the eventual goal is to deploy the model on continuously-running, unmanned sensor nodes or to enable practical large-scale measurements, the predictive model should be capable of operating with minimal human input. This means, for instance that if the model includes information about the sound source, this identification of the source should be possible to do automatically (i.e. through environmental sound recognition).\nA potential constraint for some applications is related to computation time. Since one proposed application of a predictive soundscape model is to embed the model on a WASN node, the model would then need to be able to run on relatively low-power hardware such as a Raspberry Pi with a reasonable latency. This would especially present an issue for those models which rely on the combination of several psychoacoustic features (such as Mitchell et al. 2021; Orga et al. 2021), since these features are computationally intensive to calculate and several of them may need to be computed for each time step of the model. Although this is a real practical concern that should be addressed in the future, for the sake of this initial definition of a general predictive model used across many applications, we have not considered this a strict constraint.\nGeneralisability – The third constraint is for the model to be generalisable to new locations. Ideally, it will be generalisable to new and (to it) unfamiliar soundscape types, but the minimum requirement should be that it can be applied to new locations which are otherwise similar to those in the training data. This means that any factors which are used to characterise the context provided by the location should be distinguished from a simple label of the location and should instead be derived from measurements of the location. In practice this could be geographical or architectural characteristics of the space, a proposed use-case of the space, or consistent visual characteristics of the space such as the proportion of pavement to green elements. This is in contrast to the model created in Mitchell et al. (2021) which was constrained to be used only on those locations included in the training data since it made use of a location label.\nFor this third point, some aspects of the first and second constraints can be relaxed. Since this would only need to be defined once for a location, definitions such as the use case of the space could be defined by the person using the model. What is necessary is that the model and its component location-context factors can be set up ahead of time by the user, then the recording-level effects are able to be calculated automatically. In a multi-level modelling (MLM) context (such as that used in (Mitchell et al. 2021), this essentially amounts to choosing the appropriate location-level coefficients ahead of time then automatically calculating the features which are fed into those coefficients (per constraint 1 & 2).\nRobustness – Finally, the model should be robust to missing components. If the original or full construction of the model depends on demographic information of the population using the space, in cases where this information is not available, it should be possible to omit it and still obtain a reasonable result. Here we may define potential ‘must-have’ and ‘optional’ factors. Given the amount of variance explained by the various factors which have been considered in previous predictive models, in-depth acoustic information is a must-have, while demographic and personal factors are an optional factor where the trade-off of losing 3% of the explained variance in eventfulness (Erfanian et al. 2021) is accepted as reasonable. Based on the results of Mitchell et al. (2021), it would appear that location-context is crucial for modelling the pleasantness, but not for modelling the eventfulness. In order to determine the must-have factors for characterising the location-context, more work will need to be done to determine the appropriate input factors and their relative importance."

    "text": "5 Making use of the predictions in design\nThere are various potential methods for integrating the predictive soundscape approach into a design and intervention setting. Not all spaces can or should have the same soundscape and soundscapes should be treated as dynamic, not static; identifying and creating an appropriate soundscape for the particular use case of a space is crucial to guiding its design. Proper forwardlooking design of a soundscape would involve defining the desired collective perception in the space. In the probabilistic soundscape approach from Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang (2022), this can be achieved by drawing the desired shape in the circumplex and testing interventions which will bring the existing soundscape closer to the desired perception. A soundscape may need to be perceived as vibrant during the day and calm for some portion of the evening, meaning the desired shape should primarily sit within the vibrant quadrant but have some overlap into calm. This also enables designers to recognise the limitations of their environment and acknowledge that it is not always possible to transform a highly chaotic soundscape into a calm one. In these cases, instead the focus should be placed on shifting the perception to some degree in a positive direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Adapted from Cain, Jennings, and Poxon (2013). Using the soundscape circumplex shape for target-setting for soundscape design. Reproduced with permission from Mitchell (2022).\n\n\n\nThe most sophisticated method of setting design goals is therefore to identify the desired shape which represents the variety of desired outcomes, and focus on designs and interventions which are most successful in matching the predicted outcome with that goal. This strategy of defining the optimal soundscape as an area or a shape within the 2-dimensional circumplex was previously illustrated by Cain, Jennings, and Poxon (2013). In Figure 2, we have adapted Cain’s Figure 6 to show how the shape of a target soundscape can be set and the shape of the existing soundscape compared to it. The work of a designer is then trialling intervention options which move the design soundscape closer to the target soundscape."

    "text": "6 Towards Soundscape Indices\nAlthough the types of visualisations developed in (Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang 2022) and (Cain, Jennings, and Poxon 2013) are a powerful tool for viewing, analysing, and discussing the multi-dimensional aspects of soundscape perception, there are certainly cases where simpler metrics are needed to aid discussion and to set design goals. Within the practicalities of built environment projects, the consequences and successes of a design often need to be quantifiable within a single index. Whether to demonstrate performance indicators to a client or to set and meet consistent policy requirements, numerical ratings and/or rankings are necessary. This therefore necessitates the creation of consistent and validated indices which indicate the degree to which a proposal achieves a set design goal.\nThe challenge for creating a single number index lies in properly combining the two-plus dimensions of soundscape perception with the needs of a specific project into a single index. The obvious option would be to ignore the multi-dimensionality and only score soundscape designs on the basis of their pleasantness score (as done in (Ooi et al. 2022)). However, this seems to ignore both the significant importance of the eventfulness dimension in shaping the character of a soundscape and the role of appropriateness in determining the ’optimal soundscape’ for a space. Ideally, a soundscape index (or set of soundscape indices) would succeed at capturing all these aspects into a single scoring metric."

    "text": "7 Conclusion\nThe existing methods for soundscape assessment and measurement, such as those given in the ISO 12913 series, have been focussed primarily on determining the status quo of an environment. That is, they are able to determine how the space is currently perceived, but offer little insight into hypothetical environments. As such, they are less relevant for design purposes, where a key goal is to determine how a space will be perceived, not just how an existing space is perceived. The methods for assessment outlined in ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018) and for analysis given in ISO/TS 12913-3:2019 (2019) are inherently limited to post hoc assessments of an existing space. Since they are focussed on surveying people on their experience of the environment, it stands that the space must already exist for people to be able to experience. Toward this, and following from the combination of perceptual and objective data collection encouraged in ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018), the natural push from the design perspective is towards ’predictive modelling’."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The global emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 required national lockdown measures across the world, primarily targeting human activity. In the United Kingdom, construction and transport were allowed to continue, but a decrease in activity was observed (Hadjidemetriou et al. 2020). In other countries, such as Italy, the restrictions were more severe and even included limiting people’s movement to a certain radius from their place of residence (Ren 2020). The explorations in environmental acoustics of lockdown conditions across the world have revealed various degrees of impact on the acoustic environment, with researchers reporting reductions in noise levels affecting the population at the scale of urban agglomerations such as Ruhr Area in Germany (Hornberg et al. 2021) and conurbations in the south of France (Munoz et al. 2020). Impacts have also been reported at a scale of a multimillion city such as Madrid (Asensio, Pavón, and Arcas 2020) or Barcelona (Bonet-Solà et al. 2021) as well as at a more local, city-center or even public space-scale in cities such as Stockholm (Rumpler, Venkataraman, and Göransson 2021), London (Aletta et al. 2020), Girona (Alsina-Pagès, Bergadà, and Martı́nez-Suquı́a 2021), or Granada (Vida Manzano et al. 2021). In general, these studies have demonstrated a decrease in urban noise levels and indicated a difference in the amount the level decreased depending on the type of space investigated (e.g. parks, urban squares, etc.) and the type of human activity characteristic for the space, with higher reductions in places typically associated with human sounds and activities such as shopping and tourism.\nThose studies were mostly focused around the L_{Aeq}, as well as a standardization approach to reporting subsequent changes in soundscape proposed by Asensio et al. (2020). They were not able to reveal the perceptual impact of such conditions in public spaces also because of: 1) the lack of subjective data for the exact or comparable locations in previous years; and 2) the lack of participants present in public spaces during the lockdown, hence the inability to collect soundscape data in situ. Munoz et al. (2020) combined noise measurements with an online questionnaire deployed to residents, some of which were residing in the areas covered by the noise monitoring network available. The participants were asked to recall how their lockdown area sounded before and during the first lockdown in 2020 and to describe the perceived change. They observed a consistent reduction in levels, followed by the perceived reduction of transport sounds (air and road) and an increase of natural sounds, while the resulting environment was described as pleasant, calm, and peaceful. By combining field recordings and focus groups, Sakagami (2020) and Lenzi, Sádaba, and Lindborg (2021) observed changes in the sound source composition and the affective quality of soundscape in a residential area in Kobe, Japan and a public space in Getxa, Spain, respectively, during the different stages of the lockdown period. Following the easing of lockdown measures, a decrease in animal and traffic sounds was observed in Kobe, while an increase in eventfulness, loudness, and presence of human sound sources, followed by a decrease in pleasantness, was shown in Getxa.\nAletta et al. (2020) explored the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdowns on the acoustic environment in London in particular, through many short-term (30s) binaural recordings. This study revealed that average reductions in the various locations considered ranged from 10.7 dB (L_{Aeq}) to 1.2 dB, with an overall average reduction of 5.4 dB. This metric-reporting focused approach left the following research questions unanswered: how would people have perceived these spaces as a result of this change in acoustic environment (RQ1), and would these sound level reductions result in improvements to the soundscape of the spaces (RQ2)? The 1st research question (RQ1), addressing the perceptual effect of the change in urban soundscape induced by the lockdowns, can be further broken down into the following questions: how was the sound source composition influenced by the change; how would the affective response to the acoustic environment in lockdowns change; and could this demonstrate the effect of human activities on the perception of an acoustic environment in general?\nThese questions arise out of the soundscape approach, which is characterized by prioritizing the perceptual effect of an acoustic environment by taking into account the interaction of sound sources, context, and the person perceiving it (ISO 12913-1:2014 2014; Truax 1999), bringing together objective and subjective factors. The soundscape approach to noise mitigation and management is being recognized as a response to arising environmental requirements on noise pollution and sustainability, such as the regulation of quiet areas in Europe (European Union 2002; Kang and Aletta 2018; Radicchi et al. 2021). This has been further formalized in ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018) via the adoption of the circumplex model of soundscape (Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2010), in which the perception of a soundscape can be described in terms of its pleasantness and eventfulness, as one of the standard methods of soundscape assessment.\nSoundscape research is therefore traditionally rooted in environmental acoustics and environmental psychology, typically dealing with outdoor spaces (Torresin et al. 2020) and urban open spaces, where parks and squares are often used as case study sites (Kang 2006). A soundscape assessment typically requires people to be surveyed but the presence of people at a location influences assessment (Aletta and Kang 2018) and ‘quiet places’ usually require low numbers of users to remain quiet, which limits the possibility of an assessment. Even in a crowded public space, soundscape surveys are demanding as they require significant resources to carry out at scale, limiting their widespread application (Mitchell et al. 2020). Therefore, a need for a predictive model arises to overcome this limitation and improve the implementation of the soundscape approach into everyday planning and management practices.\nAccording to a recent review of predictive soundscape models from Lionello, Aletta, and Kang (2020), the degree of employing auditory and non-auditory factors in soundscape prediction varies with some studies relying on contextual, personal/demographic (Erfanian et al. 2021; Tarlao, Steffens, and Guastavino 2020) or social media (Aiello et al. 2016) data entirely to predict and generate soundscape features. Some methods also incorporate perceptually-derived features, such as subjective sound level and visual pleasantness as predictors (Lionello, Aletta, and Kang 2020). In general, these methods which incorporate perceptually-derived inputs achieve better accuracy rates than those which don’t, however this perception information must also be obtained from people via a survey and therefore are unsuitable for predictive modeling where surveys are not possible. For example, Ricciardi et al. (2015) proposed two models based on data collected from a smartphone application to predict urban sound quality indicators based on linear regressions. The first model which incorporated perceptually-derived input features (visual quality and familiarity) achieved an R^2 of 0.72, while a second model without these features achieved an R^2 of 0.58. This indicates the necessity for considering and accounting for the influence which contextual factors in a space have on the relationship between the sound environment itself and the listener’s perception of it (i.e. the soundscape) while also highlighting the challenges associated with a predictive model which depends only on measurable features.\nTherefore, a third research question arises: what are the key features needed for a soundscape prediction model based on comprehensive acoustic on-site measurements to be used for assessing locations with low social presence or in situations where conducting surveys is impractical (RQ3)?"

    "text": "2 Materials and methods\nThis study was conducted via initial onsite data collection campaigns in Central London and Venice in 2019 before the outbreak of COVID-19 as part of the Soundscape Indices (SSID) project (Mitchell et al. 2020) and in 2020 during the strictest part of the lockdowns (Aletta et al. 2020), including objective acoustic data (2019 and 2020) and subjective responses (2019 only). The full in situ dataset, as described in this section, has been made publicly available as ‘The International Soundscape Database (V0.2.1)’ on Zenodo1(Mitchell et al. 2021).\nUsing both 2019 and 2020 binaural recordings, an online listening experiment was conducted to provide an understanding about the change in sound source composition. The 2019 onsite questionnaire data were used to define the dominant sound source at each location as a starting point for interpreting soundscape change. A predictive model was developed to reveal the change in the perceived pleasantness and eventfulness using objective acoustic data and location to predict subjective responses. Although the initial (2019) dataset contains additional locations (specifically, in Spain, the Netherlands, and China), due to the nature of this study as a reaction to the strict movement and activity restrictions, the sites which could be included in the lockdown (2020) measurement campaigns were limited to locations where staff and equipment had access and where recordings could be undertaken during the spring of 2020.\nThe sites were selected to provide a mixture of sizes and uses, varying in typology ranging from paved squares to small and large parks to waterside spaces across both cities. Throughout the text they are indexed via a LocationID based on the location’s name (e.g. CamdenTown, SanMarco), while a more in-depth overview of each is given in supplementary material2. London is taken as an example of a large, typically noisy city while the Venice sample provides a unique look at spaces with typically very high human activity levels and no road traffic activity. In particular, the 2019 Venice surveys were taken to coincide with the yearly Carnevale festival in order to capture its distinct soundscape.\nThe ISO/TS 12913 (ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 2018) series were consulted for reporting on soundscape data. A detailed description of the 2019 survey campaigns is featured throughout the paper and in the public database. This study was approved by departmental UCL IEDE Ethics Committee on 17th July 2018 for onsite data collection and on the 2nd of June 2020 for the on-line listening experiment and is conducted in adherence to the ethical requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 2013).\n\n2.1 Onsite data: Questionnaires, binaural measurements, and recordings\nThe initial onsite data collection featured both questionnaire data collected from the general public and acoustic measurements, conducted across thirteen urban locations (in London N=11, in Venice N=2) between the 28th of February and the 21st of June 2019, with additional sessions in July and October 2019. Although the total survey period in 2019 extended over several seasons, the surveys at any individual location did not extend over seasons with different occupancy patterns. A total of 1,318 questionnaire responses were collected from the general population across the measurement points during 1 – 3 hour-long campaigns in both cities in 2019, accompanied by 693 approximately 30-second long 24-bit 44.1 kHz binaural recordings. After data cleaning, each of the 13 locations was characterized by between 14 to 80 recordings and between 24 to 147 questionnaire responses. Mean age of the participants was 33.8, with a standard deviation of 14.57 (45% male, 53.8% female, 0.4% non-conforming, 0.9% prefer-not-to-say).\nAlthough recent results from both Tarlao, Steffens, and Guastavino (2020) and Erfanian et al. (2021) indicate the important influence of personal and demographic factors – in particular age and gender – on soundscape perception, these factors were not included as potential features in the modeling process. Given the nature of this study as addressing a scenario when people could not be surveyed, no additional demographic information is available in the lockdown case to be fed into the model and is therefore not useful to include for the development and application of this specific predictive model. This information is reported throughout the study simply to provide further context to the data collection.\nThe subsequent measurement campaign in 2020 mimicked the binaural recording strategy applied in the initial campaign and was performed between the 6th and the 25th of April 2020 in both cities, this time excluding the questionnaire. An additional 571 binaural recordings were collected on-site in 2020.\n\n2.1.1 Data collection\nThe 2019 data collection was performed across all the locations using the protocol based on the Method A of the ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018), as described in Aletta et al. (2020) and Mitchell et al. (2020), collected either via handheld tablets or paper copies of the questionnaire. The full questionnaire and data collection procedure are given in Mitchell et al. (2020), however the key parts used for this study are those addressing sound source dominance and perceived affective quality (PAQ).\nParticipants are first asked to rate the perceived dominance of several sound sources, as assessed via a 5-point Likert scale, coded from 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Dominates completely). The sound sources are split into four categories: Traffic noise, Other noise, Human sounds, and Natural sounds and each is rated separately. Next are the 8 PAQs which make up the circumplex model of soundscape (Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2010): pleasant, chaotic, vibrant, uneventful, calm, annoying, eventful, and monotonous. These are assessed on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). In order to simplify the results and allow for modeling the responses as continuous values, the 8 PAQs undergo a trigonometric projection to reduce them onto the two primary dimensions of pleasant and eventful, according to the procedure outlined in Part 3 of the ISO 12913 series (ISO/TS 12913-3:2019 2019). In order to distinguish the projected values from the Likert-scale PAQ responses, the projected values will be referred to as ISOPleasant and ISOEventful and can be considered to form an x-y coordinate point (x = ISOPleasant, y = ISOEventful) as explained in detail in Lionello et al. (2021).\nThe calibrated binaural device SQobold with BHS II by Head Acoustics was used in both campaigns at all the locations by various operators to capture acoustic data, as mentioned in the acknowledgments. Following the established onsite protocol (Mitchell et al. 2020), when participants were stopped in a group and filled in their responses simultaneously, a single binaural recording was used to capture their experience as a group. The purpose behind this sampling strategy was to obtain data from the perspective of a typical user, corresponding to a range of individual experiences available within an urban open space. These recordings are indexed by a GroupID such that the recording for each group is matched up to each of the corresponding respondents and their individual survey responses.\n\n\n2.1.2 Data cleaning\nThe cleaning of the samples was conducted using the ArtemiS SUITE 11. The researcher discarded or cropped whole recordings, or its parts affected by wind gusts or containing noises and speech generated by the recording operator by accident or for the purpose of explaining the questionnaire to a participant. This resulted in 1,258 binaural recordings then processed further, as described in Section 2.1.3. Psychoacoustic analyses are shown in the publicly available database3.\nIn order to maintain data quality and exclude cases where respondents either clearly did not understand the PAQ adjectives or intentionally misrepresented their answers, surveys for which the same response was given for every PAQ (e.g. ‘Strongly agree’ to all 8 attributes) were excluded prior to calculating the ISO projected values. This is justified as no reasonable respondent who understood the questions would answer that they ‘strongly agree’ that a soundscape is pleasant and annoying, calm and chaotic, etc. Cases where respondents answered ‘Neutral’ to all PAQs are not excluded in this way, as a neutral response to all attributes is not necessarily contradictory. In addition, surveys were discarded as incomplete if more than 50% of the PAQ and sound source questions were not completed.\nThe site characterization per ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018) is available in the supplementary material4 and public database5, featuring the address, overall psychoacoustic characteristics of the location, typical use of each location, and pictures taken during the survey sessions.\n\n\n2.1.3 Psychoacoustic analyses\nThe binaural recordings were analyzed in ArtemiS SUITE 11 to calculate the suite of 11 acoustic and psychoacoustic features given in Table 1 to be used as initial predictors. The (psycho)acoustic predictors investigated were selected in order to describe many aspects of the recorded sound – in particular, the goal was to move beyond a focus on sound level, which currently dominates the existing literature on the acoustic effects of lockdowns noted in Section 1. In all, they are expected to reflect the sound level (L_{Aeq}), perceived sound level (Loudness), spectral content (Sharpness, L_{Ceq}-L_{Aeq}, Tonality), temporal character or predictability (Impulsiveness, Fluctuation Strength, Relative Approach), and overall annoyance (Psychoacoustic Annoyance). These metrics have been proposed as indicators to predict perceptual constructs of the soundscape (Aletta, Kang, and Axelsson 2016; Aletta, Axelsson, and Kang 2017) and have shown promise when combined together to form a more comprehensive model applied to real-world sounds (Orga et al. 2021). The maximum value from the left and right channels of the binaural recording are used, as suggested in ISO/TS 12913-3:2019 (2019).\n\n\n\nTable 1: Psychoacoustic features considered for inclusion in the predictive models. All metrics are calculated for the full length of the recording (\\sim30s). As recommended by ISO 532-1:2017 (2017) and ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018), the 5th percentile of Loudness is used rather than the average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nSymbol\nUnit\nCalculation Method\n\n\n\n\nLoudness (5th percentile)\nN_5\nsones\nISO 532-1:2017 (2017)\n\n\nSharpness\nS\nacum\nISO 532-1:2017 (2017)\n\n\nRoughness\nR\nasper\nSottek and Genuit (2005)\n\n\nImpulsiveness\nI\niu\nSottek and Genuit (2005)\n\n\nFluctuation Strength\nFS\nvacil\nSottek and Genuit (2005)\n\n\nTonality\nT\ntuHMS\nSottek and Genuit (2005)\n\n\nPsychoacoustic Annoyance\nPA\n–\nZwicker and Fastl (2007)\n\n\nL_{Aeq}\nL_{Aeq}\ndB\nIEC 61672-1:2013 (2013)\n\n\nL_{A10}-L_{A90}\nL_{A10}-L_{A90}\ndB\nISO 1996-1:2016 (2016)\n\n\nL_{Ceq}-L_{Aeq}\nL_{Ceq}-L_{Aeq}\ndB\nISO 1996-1:2016 (2016)\n\n\nRelative Approach\nRA\ncPA\nSottek and Genuit (2005)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 shows the Pearson correlation coefficient between each of the candidate acoustic features and the outcome pleasantness and eventfulness. As all variables considered are continuous, and the eventual model is linear, the Pearson coefficient is chosen as a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. For ISOPleasant (ISOPl), we can perhaps see three tiers of correlations: the more highly correlated tier (|r| &gt; 0.28) consists of Relative Approach (RA), L_{Aeq}, Roughness (R), Loudness (N_5), and Psychoacoustic Annoyance (PA); the low correlation tier consists of L_{A10}-L_{A90}, Tonality (T), and Fluctuation Strength (FS); while L_{Ceq}-L_{Aeq}, Impulsiveness (I), and Sharpness (S) show no correlation. For ISOEventful (ISOEv), these tiers are: RA, L_{Aeq}, T, R, and N_5 comprise the most correlated tier (|r| &gt; 0.30); L_{Ceq}-L_{Aeq}, L_{A10}-L_{A90}, FS, and PA show low correlations; I and S show no correlation.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Pearson correlation coefficients between candidate acoustic features and ISOPleasant and ISOEventful across all 13 locations.

As expected, PA, L_{Aeq}, and N_5 are highly correlated, meaning that careful consideration is paid to these features to ensure they do not contribute to multicollinearity in the final model.\n\n\n\n2.2 Modelling\nTwo linear multi-level models (MLM) were computed to predict: 1) ISOPleasant, and 2) ISOEventful. These models are trained on the 2019 data only, then applied to the acoustic data collected during the 2020 lockdowns, the results of which are reported in Section 3.2.3. The inherent grouped structure of the SSID database necessitates a modeling and analysis approach which considers the differing relationships between the objective acoustic features and the soundscape’s perceived affective quality ratings across the various locations and contexts. The individual-level of the models is made up of the acoustic features calculated from the binaural recordings made during each respondent’s survey period, while the group-level includes the categorical LocationID variable indicating the location in which the survey was taken, acting as a non-auditory contextual factor.\nA separate backwards-step feature selection was performed for each of the outcome models in order to identify the minimal feature set to be used for predicting each outcome. In this feature selection process, an initial model containing all of the candidate features was fit. Each feature was then removed from the model one at a time, then the best-performing model is selected and the procedure continues step-wise until no improvement is seen by removing more features. This process is carried out first on the location-level features (including the potential to remove all features including LocationID, resulting in a ‘flat’ or standard multivariate linear regression model), then on the individual-level features. The performance criterion used for this process was the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike 1974). To check for multicollinearity among the selected features, the variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated and a threshold of VIF &lt;5 was set. Any features which remained after the backwards stepwise selection and which exceeded this threshold were investigated and removed if they were highly collinear with the other features.\nAll of the input features are numeric values, in the units described above. Before conducting feature selection, the input features are z-scaled to enable proper comparison of their effect sizes. After the feature selection, the scaled coefficients are used in the text when reporting the final fitted models to facilitate discussion and comparison between the features. The unscaled model coefficients are reported in ?@sec-appmod to enable the models to be applied to new data. In order to properly assess the predictive performance of the model, an 80/20 train-test split with a balanced shuffle across LocationIDs was used. The z-scaling and feature selection was performed on the training set only, in order to prevent data leakage. To score the performance of the model on the training and testing sets, we use the mean absolute error (MAE), which is in the scale of the response feature - for ISOPleasant this means our response can range from -1 to +1. However, since the end-goal of the model is to predict the soundscape assessment of the location as a whole, rather than the individual responses, we also assess the performance of the model in predicting the average response in each location. To do this, the mean response value for each location is calculated, and the R^2 accuracy across LocationIDs is reported for both the training and testing sets.\nThe model fitting and feature selection was performed using the step function from lmerTest (v3.1.3) (Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, and Christensen 2017) in R statistical software (v4.0.3) (R Core Team 2018). The summaries and plots were created using the sjPlot package (v2.8.6) (Lüdecke 2021) and seaborn (v0.11.1) (Waskom 2021).\n\n\n2.3 Online survey\nAn online listening test was conducted using the Gorilla Experiment Builder6 (Anwyl-Irvine et al. 2019). The participants were exposed to a random selection of 78 binaural recordings (39 from 2019 and 39 from 2020, 6 recordings per each location). Each participant had the option to evaluate either 1 or 2 sets of 6 recordings randomly assigned between 13 stimuli sets. Mp3 files, converted at 256 kBps were used due to the requirements of the Gorilla platform.\nNo visual stimuli were used in the experiment. The experiment consisted of: 1) an initial exercise to enhance chances of participants complying to the instructions and wearing headphones; 2) a training set using two randomly chosen binaural recordings (then not used in the main task) from the dataset; 3) a soundscape characterization questionnaire starting with an open-ended question about perceived sound sources and featuring the same questions as the one used in situ, looking into the perceived affective quality of the soundscape and the perceived sound source dominance of the following four types: traffic noise, other noise, human sounds and natural sounds; 4) a questionnaire on the basic demographic factors. The questionnaire used in the Part 3 of the online experiment is reported in Appendix A.\nHaving in mind the remote nature of the study and to ensure a minimum level of robustness for reliable sound source recognition, an initial exercise was performed consisting of a headphone screening test (Woods et al. 2017) and a headphone reproduction level adjustment test (Gontier et al. 2019). The level adjustment was performed using an eleven-second-long pink noise sample matched to the lowest and the highest L_{A90} values from the experimental set. Participants were asked to adjust their listening level to clearly hear the quieter sample while keeping the level low enough, so they don’t find the louder sample disturbing. The headphones screening test followed, featuring a stereo signal of one-second-long 100 Hz sine tone, generated with Izotope RX 6 application, played at a 3 dB difference where one of the equally loud pairs had its phase inverted. A 100 Hz sine was used because the pilot tests revealed the 200 Hz sine tone proposed by Woods et al. (2017) created a higher uncertainty varying across different laptop models and would likely contribute to the chances of a participant fooling the test. It was expected that participants using speakers would not be able to either hear the sine wave or would be fooled by the inverted phase effect and therefore not able to pass the trials, unless they were indeed using headphones. The participant needed to recognize the quietest of the 3 samples in a trial of 6 attempts. Only participants correctly answering 5 or more out of 6 trials were allowed to proceed with the experiment. Participants were asked not to change their audio output settings during the rest of the experiment. (This was introduced to ensure that a participant is using a headphones playback system which allows a listener to clearly recognize a 3 dB difference at 100 Hz as a proxy for sufficient audio quality playback.)\nHowever, after the initial data collection, questions were raised as to how the playback loudness impacts ecological validity as it relates to the perceived affective quality of the soundscape. Given this concern, the PAQ responses from the online surveys were not included in further data analysis. Sound source identification is not considered to suffer the same validity concerns as this is not directly dependent on absolute playback level and requires only that the participant can clearly hear what is present. The purpose of the calibration procedure described above was to ensure the participant could clearly hear the softest samples used.\nOnline questionnaire data was collected between the 9th of June and the 9th of August 2020. Within the Gorilla Experiment Builder, a total of 250 attempts to complete the experiment were recorded, where 165 participants were excluded either on the basis of not passing the headphones screening (N=79) or for not completing the experiment, usually before engaging into the screening (N=83). Out of a total of 88 participants who completed the test, 2 participants were excluded as outliers as they provided uniform answers across all the questions and commented on not being able to properly hear the stimuli, despite their successful completion of the training tests. The participants of the online experiment were of mean age 32.42, 45.1% male, 54.9% female.\nFigure 1 illustrates and summarizes the framework and sections described above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The study flowchart indicating the data collection, analysis, modeling, and discussion throughout the study.

    "text": "3 Results\nThe results of the onsite surveys, online experiment, and the model development are reported here. They are reported following the structure of the ISO/TS 12913 series, revealing the perceived sound source dominance, key perceptual attributes (ISOPleasant and ISOEventful) and the lockdown-related changes.\n\n3.1 Perceived sound source dominance\n\n3.1.1 2019 sound source composition per location\nQuestionnaire data was collected in English, Italian, and Spanish in both cities. The respective questionnaires can be found in the supplementary files and Mitchell et al. (2020). Data presented here was aggregated per LocationID.\nAccording to the highest scored mean value of the dominant sound source type, as shown in Figure 2, the locations can be grouped into: natural sounds dominated (RegentsParkJapan, RegentsParkFields, RussellSq), human sounds dominated (SanMarco, TateModern, StPaulsRow, StPaulsCross, MonumentoGaribaldi), noise (traffic and other noise) sounds dominated (CamdenTown, EustonTap, TorringtonSq, PancrasLock). Traffic noise and Other noise have been combined here, and for the rest of the discussion, as these responses are highly correlated within this dataset and it is not helpful to consider them separately for this analysis. This follows the alternative sound source labels given in Figure C.3 of ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018) which combines Traffic and Other Noise. Finally, MarchmontGarden is unique in that all sound source types are assessed as being nearly equally present, with only 0.2 separating the least present (Other noise, 2.5) and the most present (Traffic noise, 2.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: (Color online) Mean response per Location ID for the perceived dominance of the sound source types, for the 2019 on-site campaign. The values represent the mean response of all participants in each location to the question “To what extent do you presently hear the following four types of sounds?”. Response values range from [1] Not at all to [5] Dominates completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Overall change in the perceived sound source dominance during lockdown\n1803 words describing the sound sources present in the 2019 recordings and 1395 words related to the 2020 recordings were input by participants in response to the open-ended question Q1 (see Appendix A). The frequency of occurrence, generated using the WordClouds web app, is shown in the Figure 3, for the 2019 and the 2020 sets respectively. The most frequent words from both 2019 and 2020 groups are: noise, car/traffic, bird/birds, talk/voice and (foot)steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A graphic illustrating the frequency of occurrence of the sound sources reported by the participants of the online study across all locations, shown for recordings from the 2019 (above) and 2020 (below).\n\n\n\nThe results from the listening tests deployed online were analyzed using the SPSS Statistics v. 25. Levene’s test for equality of variances resulted in highly statistically significant values for all 4 sound sources investigated (less than 0.001). Therefore, a Mann-Whitney U-test test was used as a non-parametric equivalent to the T-test to investigate the change in the perceived dominance of the four sound source types (McKnight and Najab 2010). The results for human sounds indicated that the perceived dominance was greater for the 2019 sample (M=3.82), than for the 2020 sample (M=2.62), U=41,656, p &lt; 0.001. The results for natural sounds indicated the perceived dominance increased from 2019 (M=2.00) to 2020 (M=2.54), U=63,797, p &lt; 0.001. However, the differences for the noise sources (traffic and other) were not statistically significant. The result of these changes is that while Human sounds were the clearly dominant source across the whole dataset in 2019, in 2020 the sound sources are, on average, much more evenly balanced. No single sound source category was identified as frequent across the 2020 dataset.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Mean values and standard deviation for the perceived dominance of sound sources (rated from 1 - 5), assessed via an online survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSound source type\nCampaign\nN\nMean\nStandard deviation\nStandard error mean\n\n\n\n\nTraffic\n2019\n422\n2.51\n1.369\n0.067\n\n\n\n2020\n383\n2.56\n1.525\n0.078\n\n\nOther\n2019\n422\n2.00\n1.182\n0.058\n\n\n\n2020\n382\n2.23\n1.333\n0.068\n\n\nHuman\n2019\n423\n3.82\n1.143\n0.056\n\n\n\n2020\n382\n2.62\n1.346\n0.069\n\n\nNatural\n2019\n424\n2.00\n1.307\n0.063\n\n\n\n2020\n380\n2.54\n1.441\n0.074\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Model selection, performance, and application\n\n\n\nTable 4: Scaled linear regression models of ISOPleasant and ISOEventful for 13 locations in London and Venice.

The training and testing MAE are very similar, indicating that the model is neither over- nor under-fitting to the training data (MAE_{train} = 0.258; MAE_{test} = 0.259). The model performs very well at predicting the average soundscape assessment of the locations (R^2_{train} = 0.998; R^2_{test} = 0.85).\nThe high intraclass correlation (ICC = 0.90) demonstrates that the location-level effects are highly important in predicting the pleasantness dimension. Within this random-intercept random-slope model structure, these effects include both the specific context of the location (i.e. the LocationID factor), but also the L_{Aeq}, L_{A10}-L_{A90}, and L_{Ceq}-L_{Aeq} features whose effects vary across locations. These slopes are given in Figure 4. This point highlights the need to consider how the context of a location will influence the relationship between the acoustic features and the perceived pleasantness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: (Color online) Location-level scaled coefficients for the ISOPleasant model.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 ISOEventful model selected\nThrough the group-level feature selection, all of the group-level coefficients were removed, including the LocationID factor itself. Therefore the final ISOEventful model is a ‘flat’ multi-variate linear regression model, rather than a multi-level model. The ISOEventful model is a linear combination of S, FS, T, L_{Aeq}, and L_{Ceq}-L_{Aeq}. The training and testing MAE are very similar, indicating that the model is not over-fit to the training data (MAE_{train} = 0.233; MAE_{test} = 0.231). The model performs slightly worse than the ISOPleasant at predicting the mean location responses, but still performs well (R^2_{train} = 0.873; R^2_{test} = 0.715).\n\n\n3.2.3 Application to lockdown data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: (Color online) Soundscape circumplex coordinates for (a) the mean ISOPleasant and ISOEventful responses for each location; and (b) the mean predicted responses based on recordings made during the lockdown and the change in the location’s placement in the circumplex. In (b) the marker outline is shown for the 2019 location, red arrows indicate the change in the location’s coordinates.\n\n\n\nOnce the two models were built and assessed, they were then applied to the lockdown recording data in order to predict the new soundscape ISO coordinates. Figure 5 (a) shows the pre-lockdown ISO coordinates for each location and Figure 5 (b) shows how the soundscapes are predicted to have been assessed during the lockdown period. As in the model assessment process, the predicted responses are calculated for each recording individually, then the mean for each location is calculated and plotted on the circumplex.\nIn 2019 the majority of locations in the dataset fall within the ‘vibrant’ quadrant of the circumplex, particularly those which are primarily dominated by human activity (e.g. San Marco, Tate Modern). Camden Town and Euston Tap, which are both in general visually and acoustically dominated by traffic, are the only two to be rated as ‘chaotic’, while no locations are overall considered to be ‘monotonous’. During the 2020 lockdown, there is general positive move along the ‘pleasant’ dimension and general negative move along the ‘eventful’ dimension, but several different patterns of movement can be noted. These are investigated further in the Discussion section below."

    "text": "4 Discussion\n\n4.1 Interpretation of the results\nTo interpret the results addressing the RQ1 and RQ2, it is necessary to separately look into the overall change in sound source composition, and the change in the affective quality of soundscapes per location.\n\n4.1.1 Change in the sound source composition\nThe open-ended question about sound sources in the online survey did not reveal a change in sound source types but rather confirmed that all types were still present in both conditions. The sound source composition question taken from the Method A of the ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018) revealed a statistically significant reduction in human sound sources and a significant increase in the perceived dominance of natural sound sources.\nThe most frequent sound sources detected from the open-ended question correspond to the main four sound source types investigated, which indicated that all types remained present in the lockdown condition (at all the locations). While traffic intensity might have gone down, where the results of the Mann-Whitney U-test were inconclusive, but supported by the psychoacoustic measurements (Aletta et al. 2020), traffic-related sound sources were still clearly present.\nThe sound source composition of an outdoor acoustic environment is extremely complex. Removing one component, such as human sounds, has implications on the whole (Gordo et al. 2021). Testing the effects of this in situ is not straightforward and interpreting this study in line with ‘what is the impact of human sounds’ must be taken within the broader context of the range of conditions which changed within the acoustic environment. However, looking at the overarching picture, the lockdown condition was a useful and unique case study to understand the impact which human activities – and the human sound source type in particular – can have on soundscape perception of urban open spaces.\n\n\n4.1.2 Predicted relative changes in soundscapes due to COVID-19 restrictions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: (Color online) The relative change in soundscape perception in the circumplex due to the COVID-19 lockdowns as predicted by the models, represented as vectors centered on the origin. The lawn-works dominated session is shown separately as MonumentoGaribaldi with a gray arrow to indicate that this is distinct from the effects of the lockdown changes.\n\n\n\nIn order to interpret how the change of the acoustic environment at the locations examined would have been perceived, and to answer RQ2, relative change vectors within the circumplex space are shown in Figure . This clearly shows a few different patterns of soundscape change due to the effects of the 2020 lockdown. These can be further looked into depending on the magnitude and direction of change, shifts between quadrants shown in Figure 5, and the sound source composition. The discussion below is organized according to groups of locations which show similar behaviors in the predicted magnitude and direction of change, or discusses a single location which is particularly notable.\n\n4.1.2.1 Piazza San Marco\nThe largest change is seen in Piazza San Marco, with a predicted increase in pleasantness of 0.24 and a decrease in eventfulness of 0.44, enough to move the soundscape out of the ‘vibrant’ quadrant and into ‘calm’. This extreme change (relative to the rest of the locations) is exactly what would be expected given the unique context of the measurements taken in 2019 – the measurement campaign corresponded with Carnevale, a yearly festival which centers around the square. By contrast, due to the particularly strict measures imposed in Italy, during the lockdown measurement period, the square was almost entirely devoid of people. What is promising is that, without any of this contextual information about the presence or absence of people, our model is able to capture and reflect what may be considered a reasonable and expected direction and scale of change within the soundscape circumplex.\n\n\n4.1.2.2 Locations showing an increase in pleasantness\nThe next locations of interest are those which, in the 2019 survey data, were rated as being dominated by traffic noise: Euston Tap, Camden Town, Torrington Square, and Pancras Lock. These are the only locations (besides San Marco) which show a predicted increase in pleasantness. Of these traffic-dominated spaces, the two which were most heavily dominated by traffic noise (Camden Town and Euston Tap) showed the most increase in pleasantness, with Torrington Square having slightly less of an increase. Pancras Lock, which was also rated as having high levels of both Human and Natural sounds shows only a modest improvement in pleasantness.\n\n\n4.1.2.3 Locations showing a decrease in pleasantness\nAmong the locations which are predicted to experience a negative effect on pleasantness we see a mix of spaces which were assessed as being dominated by Human (St Pauls Cross and Tate Modern) and Natural (Regents Park Japan, Regents Park Fields, Russell Square) sounds before the lockdown. It is hard to discern a pattern of difference between these two groups, although it appears that the Human-dominated spaces saw a greater reduction in eventfulness, compared to the Natural-dominated spaces.\nIn general, we note that most of the spaces experience some degree of reduction in eventfulness. This pattern is particularly consistent with what would be expected from a reduction in human presence in these spaces (Aletta and Kang 2018), as reflected by the observation that, in general, those spaces which had the most human sounds prior to the lockdown showed the greatest reduction in eventfulness during the lockdown. In particular, Tate Modern, Camden Town, and Torrington Square show the greatest reduction in eventfulness. This appears to be due to these locations showing the greatest reduction in overall L_{Aeq} compared to other locations (8.1 dB, 5.2 dB, and 9.2 dB, respectively), with L_{Aeq} being the most influential feature in the eventfulness model, as shown in Table 4. However, Russell Square also experienced a large decrease in L_{Aeq} on average (10.5 dB) but does not show the same reduction in eventfulness. This appears due to the correspondingly large decrease in S (1.17 acum) which is not seen at the 3 previously mentioned locations. Russell Square normally features a medium-sized jet fountain which was turned off during the lockdowns in 2020 and therefore it experienced a drop in the overall sound level, but an increase in the proportion of low frequency noise to high frequency noise reflected by a decrease in sharpness which, within the eventfulness model, effectively cancels out the impact of the reduction in L_{Aeq}. While the overall sound level has an important impact, in order to determine the true impact a reduction in sound level may have, it must be taken in context with how the other aspects of the sound will also change.\n\n\n4.1.2.4 Euston Tap\nAn unexpected result is that Euston Tap is predicted to experience an increase in eventfulness and it is unclear whether this accurately reflects the real experience people would have had in the space. Normally, Euston Tap is a mostly-outdoor drinking venue located at the entrance to London Euston Station and situated directly along a very busy central London road. During the 2020 survey, the researchers noted that the music and chatter of people from the pub was noticeably missing, but that the perceived reduction in road traffic was minimal. Based on the theory of vibrancy which would suggest it is driven by human presence and sounds (Aletta and Kang 2018), we would not therefore expect a shift in the vibrant direction as indicated here. This discrepancy may reveal a weakness in the context-independent ISOEventful model, or it may in fact be indicating that, at certain thresholds of traffic noise, a reduction in level – and therefore a reduction in energetic masking – will allow other aspects of the sound to influence the perception.\n\n\n4.1.2.5 Monumento Garibaldi\nFinally, special attention should be paid to the results shown for Monumento Garibaldi, which in 2019 was perceived as a pleasant and slightly calm green space featuring a gravel walkway. During the first measurement session during the lockdown in 2020, the researcher noted that the soundscape was dominated by landscaping works, in particular noise from strimmers (or weed whackers). In order to gain a sample which was more representative of the impact of the lockdowns, the researcher returned another day to repeat the measurements without interference from the works.\nTo examine the impact of these two scenarios separately, the prediction model was fitted to the data from the two sessions independently and the session which was impacted by the landscaping works is shown in Figure 6 in gray and labeled MonumentoGaribaldi*, while the unaffected session is shown in red. In the latter case, the predicted change in soundscape as a result of the lockdown fits neatly into what would be expected and closely matches the predicted behavior of similar locations in London (i.e. Marchmont Garden and Russell Square). On the other hand, the session which was dominated by noise from the strimmers is predicted to have become much more chaotic, with a decrease in pleasantness of 0.16 and an increase in eventfulness of 0.27. This indicates that, although the model has no contextual information about the type of sound and in fact the training data never included sounds from similar equipment, just based on the psychoacoustic features of the sound it is able to reasonably predict the expected change in soundscape.\n\n\n4.1.2.6 General notes\nAs a whole, the primary impact of the 2020 lockdowns on the soundscapes in London and Venice was an overall decrease in eventfulness. With the exception of Euston Tap, all of the sessions show some degree of reduction in eventfulness, reflecting the general decrease in sound levels and human sound sources across the locations. The impact of the lockdowns on pleasantness is more mixed and seems to be driven by the previous dominance of traffic noise in the space. However, it could also be noted that, while all locations experienced a reduction in sound level, those which are predicted to become more pleasant had an average L_{Aeq} above 60 dB in 2019. By contrast, the locations which were predicted to experience a decrease in pleasantness generally had sound levels below 60 dBA in 2019. This may indicate that reductions in sound level can improve pleasantness when the sound level exceeds some threshold of around 60 - 65 dBA but are ineffective when sound levels are below this threshold. Similarly, Yang and Kang (2005) showed that, when the sound level is ‘lower than a certain value, say 70 dB’ there is no longer a significant improvement in the evaluation of acoustic comfort as the sound level reduces. It is unclear at this point where this threshold would lie for pleasantness/annoyance, how strict it may be, or how it is impacted by the sound source composition of the acoustic environment, therefore further research is needed in this area.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Model selection results\nThe most immediately interesting result of the model-building and feature selection process, answering to RQ3, is the apparent irrelevance of location context to the ISOEventful dimension. The multilevel model structure was chosen since the starting assumption was that soundscape perception is heavily influenced by contextual factors, such as expectations of the space and visual context (Ricciardi et al. 2015). For this modeling, these factors can be considered as location-level latent variables at least partially accounted for by the inclusion of the LocationID as the second-level factor. While this assumption certainly held true for ISOPleasant, our results indicate that these types of contextual factors are not significant for ISOEventful, and do not affect the relationship between the acoustic features of the sound and the perception.\nIn particular this result may herald a shift in modeling approach for soundscapes – where previous methods, in both the soundscape and noise paradigms, have mostly focused on deriving acoustic models of annoyance (in other words have focused on the ISOPleasant dimension) perhaps they should instead consider the acoustic models as primarily describing the eventfulness dimension when considered in situ. In addition this study takes the approach of modeling responses at an individual level in order to derive the soundscape assessment of the location. Rather than either attempting to represent the predicted response of an individual person – which is less useful in this sort of practical application – or to base the model on average metrics of the location, the goal is instead to characterize the location itself, through the aggregated predicted responses of individuals. The authors believe this modeling approach better addresses the practical goal of predictive soundscape modeling and reflects the structure of the data collection.\n\n\n\n4.2 Limitations of the study\nThe onsite sampling method was initially not intended as the ultimate characterization of a location’s soundscape but rather as a tool for model development. Therefore, the change observed does not necessarily represent the ground truth about the site’s soundscape, if such a thing exists. Further, the online listening tests took a relatively small but random sample from the available database and did not include any contextual information. This proved to be sufficient for the purpose of detecting a change in sound source composition, however the relatively small sample of recordings included in the online study does limit how representative they are of the location’s sound environment as a whole. Similarly, the surveys and recordings taken represent only a snapshot of the soundscape or sound environment for a short period in time. This is a flaw in most soundscape sampling methods presented both in the literature and in ISO/TS 12913-2. To truly be said to characterize the soundscape of a space, long-term monitoring and survey methods will need to be developed in order to capture the changing environmental and contextual conditions in the space. Models of the sort presented here, which are based on measurable quantities, could prove to be useful in this sort of longterm monitoring as they could take continuous inputs from sensors and generate the likely soundscape assessment over time.\nThe audio-visual interaction forms a key component in people’s perception of urban spaces. This consideration has been a strength of soundscape research and has been incorporated via the use of in situ data collection. However, the visual aspect, and in particular how the visual environment changed as a result of the lockdown condition, was not considered in this study, reducing the comprehensiveness of the model. This was due primarily to data collection limitations imposed by the lockdown restrictions which made it impractical to replicate the 360^{\\circ} videos made during the 2019 sessions. Future work on comprehensive predictive soundscape models should strive to make use of this visual aspect within their considered features.\nThe limitation of the sound source categorization adopted from the ISO standard is that it may not be clear to a respondent in which category they would place community sounds like church bells and music. This may be particularly relevant for comparing the lockdown condition, as in particular the ringing of bells for worship varied in different contexts throughout the pandemic. Whether bells ceased entirely or were increased not only would have an impact on the sound environment, but the purposeful action behind the decision to ring bells may have changed to public’s relationship to and perception of the sound itself (Parker and Spennemann 2020). The open ended question on sound sources, however, revealed the presence of church bells in both years. Unfortunately, this is a limitation of the sound source categories given by the ISO standard on which this questionnaire was based. A sensible update based on the findings and experiences reported here would be to combine the Traffic and Other Noise categories as separating them does not appear to provide additional information, and to include a new category which would in some way encapsulate the types of community sounds for which there is currently not a clear category.\nFurther, the lockdown condition is likely to cause distortions of the circumplex soundscape perception model. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that all the predictions were made for the people with no experience of the pandemic and its psychological effects. Conceptually, this model captured the perceptual mapping (i.e. the relationship between the acoustic indicator inputs and the soundscape descriptor outputs) of people in 2019, but this perceptual mapping is likely to have been affected by the psychological and contextual impacts of the lockdown itself, independent of its changes on the sound environment. Future research might look into potential perception changes in the post-pandemic world."

    "text": "5 Conclusion\nThis study demonstrates an application of predictive modeling to the field of soundscape studies. The model building results reveal that, within this dataset, an approach based on psychoacoustics can achieve R^2 = 0.85 for predicting the pleasantness of locations and R^2 = 0.715 for predicting the eventfulness. A modeling–focused method of this sort is a key component to the potential scalability of the soundscape approach to applications such as smart city sensing, urban planning, and cost-effective, sustainable design. To demonstrate the usefulness and feasibility of such an approach, we apply our predictive model to a unique case study in which traditional soundscape survey methods were impossible.\nBy applying this predictive model to recordings collected during the 2020 lockdown, the change in perception of the urban soundscapes is revealed. In general, soundscapes became less eventful, and those locations which were previously dominated by traffic noise became more pleasant. By contrast, previously human- and natural-dominated locations are in fact predicted to become less pleasant despite the decrease in sound levels. While all sound source categories remained present in both years, overall, in 2020 a decrease in human sounds’ dominance was observed together with an increase in the perceived dominance of natural sounds. Although these results are limited in that they represent one snapshot of the soundscape of the spaces, the success of the model in responding to new and disturbing sound events demonstrates its potential usefulness in long-term monitoring of urban soundscapes."

    "text": "2.2 Objective Functions\nOur optimization problem requires carefully chosen objective functions that can effectively translate an ordinal ranking of soundscape quality into meaningful MSN parameters. Two competing objectives are defined to ensure the resulting target distribution is both valid and useful:\n\nRank Correlation Objective:\n\nf_1 = r(ranks_{quality}, ranks_{target})\n\nwhere r is the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. This objective ensures the derived target preserves the original quality ordering of the soundscapes. A high rank correlation indicates that when the target is used to calculate SPI scores for each location, those scores produce a similar ranking to our a priori assessment.\nWeighted SPI Objective:\n\nf_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{rank_i} \\cdot SPI_i\n\nwhere m is the number of locations and rank_i is the a priori rank of location i. This objective addresses several important aspects:\n\nIt ensures the target produces meaningfully scaled scores, not just correct rankings\nThe weighting (\\frac{1}{rank_i}) prioritizes high SPI scores for locations ranked as high quality\nIt prevents solutions that achieve the correct ranking but with compressed or arbitrary score ranges\nIt helps anchor the target distribution in regions of the circumplex space associated with positive soundscape experiences for this context.\n\n\nThe two objectives work together to resolve key challenges in target derivation:\n\nRank correlation alone could produce valid but impractical targets (e.g., targets that correctly rank soundscapes but give very low scores to all locations)\nWeighted scores alone might maximize scores without preserving the relative quality relationships\nTogether, they ensure the target both discriminates between soundscape quality levels and produces scores that reflect absolute quality judgments\n\nIn pymoo, each objective function is supposed to be minimized. Therefore, in the code implementation these objectives are negated to convert them into minimization problems. For each step in the algorithm with a given trial set of parameters, a target distribution will be produced, the SPI for each test location assessed according to the protocol described in the full paper, and the resulting set of SPI scores and ranking will be scored using the objective functions."

A naive approach might involve systematically sampling the parameter space through a grid search, evaluating both objective functions at each point. However, with seven parameters to optimize and the need for fine granularity to capture optimal solutions, the search space becomes prohibitively large. Additionally, the requirement that the covariance matrix must be positive definite creates irregular boundaries in the parameter space that make systematic searching impractical.\nWe therefore employ the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), which uses principles from evolutionary computation to search the parameter space efficiently. The algorithm maintains a population of potential solutions, where each solution represents a complete set of MSN parameters (ξ, Ω, α). In our implementation, we use a population of 150 solutions, initialized randomly within the parameter constraints defined in Section 2.1.\n\nfrom pymoo.algorithms.moo.nsga2 import NSGA2\nfrom pymoo.operators.crossover.sbx import SBX\nfrom pymoo.operators.mutation.pm import PM\nfrom pymoo.operators.sampling.rnd import FloatRandomSampling\nfrom pymoo.optimize import minimize\nfrom pymoo.termination.default import DefaultMultiObjectiveTermination\n\nalgorithm = NSGA2(\n    pop_size=150,\n    sampling=FloatRandomSampling(),\n    crossover=SBX(),\n    mutation=PM(),\n    eliminate_duplicates=True,\n    # callback=VideoCallback()\n)\n\ntermination = DefaultMultiObjectiveTermination(n_max_gen=100)\n\nThe algorithm proceeds iteratively, with each iteration (or generation) involving four main steps:\nFirst, the algorithm evaluates both objective functions (rank correlation and weighted scores) for each solution in the current population. Since we have multiple objectives, there is rarely a single “best” solution. Instead, solutions are ranked based on dominance - solution A dominates solution B if it performs at least as well on both objectives and better on at least one. Solutions that are not dominated by any other solutions form the first front, those only dominated by solutions in the first front form the second front, and so on.\nSecond, to maintain diversity in the population, the algorithm calculates a “crowding distance” for each solution. This distance measures how close a solution is to its neighbors in terms of objective function values. Solutions that are more isolated (have larger crowding distances) are preferred to prevent the population from clustering too tightly around local optima.\nThird, new solutions are generated through crossover and mutation operations. Crossover combines parameters from two parent solutions to create offspring solutions, while mutation introduces small random changes to parameter values. These operations are controlled to ensure new solutions remain within the valid parameter ranges and covariance matrix constraints.\nFinally, the algorithm selects solutions to form the next generation’s population. Solutions are chosen primarily based on their front ranking (lower/better fronts are preferred), and within the same front, solutions with larger crowding distances are preferred. This selection process ensures both convergence toward better solutions and maintenance of diversity in the population.\nThe algorithm runs for 100 generations, producing a set of solutions known as the Pareto front - solutions representing different trade-offs between our two objectives. From this front, we select a final solution using an Augmented Scalarizing Function with weights [0.48, 0.52], indicating a slight preference for the weighted score objective while maintaining strong rank correlation."

    "text": "2.5 Selecting the best solution\nThe optimization produces a set of non-dominated solutions forming a Pareto front, where each point represents a different set of MSN parameters. However, selecting a single solution from this front requires careful consideration of the relative scales of our objective functions. The rank correlation objective (f₁) typically ranges from -1 to 1, while the weighted SPI score objective (f₂) can range from 0 to 100. This difference in scales means we cannot directly compare or combine these objectives without normalization.\nTo address this scale disparity, we first approximate the boundaries of our objective space using the best and worst values found for each objective during the optimization process. These boundary points (called the ideal and nadir points) allow us to normalize both objectives to a common scale ranging from 0 to 1. The normalized front maintains the same trade-off relationships between solutions but allows for fair weighting in the final selection process.\nTo select a single solution from this normalized front, we employ the Augmented Scalarization Function (ASF). The ASF combines multiple objectives into a single metric while maintaining Pareto optimality. We assign equal weights [0.5, 0.5] to both objectives, indicating no preference between ranking accuracy and score distribution. The ASF also includes a small augmentation term that ensures we select solutions that perform reasonably well on both objectives rather than extremely well on one but poorly on the other.\nThe solution minimizing the ASF yields the following MSN parameters:\n\nfrom pymoo.decomposition.asf import ASF\n\n# Get the approximated ideal and nadir points\napprox_ideal = park_res.F.min(axis=0)\napprox_nadir = park_res.F.max(axis=0)\n\n# Normalize the obtained front\nnF = (park_res.F - approx_ideal) / (approx_nadir - approx_ideal)\n\nweights = np.array([0.4, 0.5])\ndecomp = ASF()\n\npark_I = decomp(nF, weights).argmin()\n# print(\"Best regarding decomposition: Point %s - %s\" % (park_I, park_res.F[park_I]))\n\nprint(park_tgt.summary())\n\nFitted from direct parameters.\nDirect Parameters:\nxi:    [0.637 0.403]\nomega: [[0.131 0.018]\n [0.018 0.262]]\nalpha: [  2.502 -11.987]\n\n\nNone\nNone\n\n\nThese parameters define a target distribution that achieves a rank correlation of 0.714 with the a priori ranking while maintaining meaningfully scaled SPI scores. The location parameters (\\xi) place the distribution’s center in the vibrant quadrant of the circumplex, while the covariance matrix (\\Omega) describes a moderately spread distribution with positive correlation between pleasantness and eventfulness. The skewness parameters (\\alpha) indicate strong negative skew, particularly in the eventfulness dimension, suggesting the target favors soundscapes that avoid high eventfulness while maintaining moderate to high pleasantness."

    "text": "2.6 Resulting Target Distribution\nFigure 1 (a) shows the Pareto front obtained from the optimization process, where each point represents a different set of MSN parameters and their corresponding objective function values. The x-axis shows the negative rank correlation (-f₁) and the y-axis shows the negative weighted SPI score (-f₂). The selected solution using the ASF with equal weights is highlighted in red. The spread of solutions along the front illustrates the fundamental trade-off between achieving perfect rank correlation and maximizing SPI scores.\nFigure 1 (b) shows the resulting target distribution in the soundscape circumplex model, sampled from the MSN parameters of our selected solution. The distribution is centered in the pleasant-eventful quadrant but shows clear asymmetry, with a longer tail extending into the calm quadrant. This shape suggests that while the target generally favors pleasant soundscapes, it is more tolerant of variation in eventfulness than in pleasantness. The moderate spread of the distribution indicates that the target allows for some natural variation in perception while still maintaining clear preferences for certain regions of the circumplex.\nTogether, these visualizations demonstrate both the optimization process (through the Pareto front) and its outcome (through the target distribution). The selected solution represents a balanced compromise between maintaining ranking accuracy and producing meaningful score distributions, while the resulting target distribution aligns with theoretical expectations about high-quality park soundscapes.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\npark_X = park_res.X[park_I]\npark_tgt = MultiSkewNorm()\npark_tgt.define_dp(\n    np.array([park_X[0], park_X[1]]),\n    np.array([[park_X[2], park_X[4]], [park_X[4], park_X[3]]]),\n    np.array([park_X[5], park_X[6]]),\n)\npark_tgt.sample()\n\n# print(park_tgt.summary())\n\nplot = Scatter()\nplot.add(park_res.F, color=\"blue\", alpha=0.2, s=10)\nplot.add(park_res.F[park_I], color=\"red\", s=30)\nplot.do()\n# plot.apply(lambda ax: ax.arrow(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5, color='black',\n#                                head_width=0.01, head_length=0.01, alpha=0.4))\nplot.show()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n# park_tgt.sspy_plot()\ndf = pd.DataFrame(park_tgt.sample_data, columns=[\"ISOPleasant\", \"ISOEventful\"])\nsspy.plotting.density_plot(\n    df, color='red', title=None\n)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Multi-objective optimization Pareto front.

This projection method and its associated formulae were recently updated further in (Aletta2024?) to include a correction for the language in which the survey was conducted. The formulae are as follows:\n\n% \\begin{align*}\nP_{ISO} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{pl}} \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\cos \\theta_i \\cdot \\sigma_i \\\\\nE_{ISO} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{pl}} \\sum_{i=1}^{8} \\sin \\theta_i \\cdot \\sigma_i\n% \\end{align*}\n\nwhere $_i$ is the response to the (i)th item of the PAQ. The resulting (x) and (y) values are then used to calculate the polar angle () and the radial distance (r) as follows:\n\nfrom soundscapy.surveys.survey_utils import LANGUAGE_ANGLES, PAQ_IDS\n\nLANGUAGE_ANGLES\n\n{'eng': (0, 46, 94, 138, 177, 241, 275, 340),\n 'arb': (0, 36, 45, 135, 167, 201, 242, 308),\n 'cmn': (0, 18, 38, 154, 171, 196, 217, 318),\n 'hrv': (0, 84, 93, 160, 173, 243, 273, 354),\n 'nld': (0, 43, 111, 125, 174, 257, 307, 341),\n 'deu': (0, 64, 97, 132, 182, 254, 282, 336),\n 'ell': (0, 72, 86, 133, 161, 233, 267, 328),\n 'ind': (0, 53, 104, 123, 139, 202, 284, 308),\n 'ita': (0, 57, 104, 143, 170, 274, 285, 336),\n 'spa': (0, 41, 103, 147, 174, 238, 279, 332),\n 'swe': (0, 66, 87, 146, 175, 249, 275, 335),\n 'tur': (0, 55, 97, 106, 157, 254, 289, 313)}\n\n\n\ntab = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(LANGUAGE_ANGLES, orient='index', columns=PAQ_IDS)\ntab\n\n\n\nTable 1: Language-specific angles for projection into the ISO 12913-3:2018 circumplex space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPAQ1\nPAQ2\nPAQ3\nPAQ4\nPAQ5\nPAQ6\nPAQ7\nPAQ8\n\n\n\n\neng\n0\n46\n94\n138\n177\n241\n275\n340\n\n\narb\n0\n36\n45\n135\n167\n201\n242\n308\n\n\ncmn\n0\n18\n38\n154\n171\n196\n217\n318\n\n\nhrv\n0\n84\n93\n160\n173\n243\n273\n354\n\n\nnld\n0\n43\n111\n125\n174\n257\n307\n341\n\n\ndeu\n0\n64\n97\n132\n182\n254\n282\n336\n\n\nell\n0\n72\n86\n133\n161\n233\n267\n328\n\n\nind\n0\n53\n104\n123\n139\n202\n284\n308\n\n\nita\n0\n57\n104\n143\n170\n274\n285\n336\n\n\nspa\n0\n41\n103\n147\n174\n238\n279\n332\n\n\nswe\n0\n66\n87\n146\n175\n249\n275\n335\n\n\ntur\n0\n55\n97\n106\n157\n254\n289\n313\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom soundscapy.surveys.survey_utils import PAQ_IDS\n\nfor i, row in data.iterrows():\n    lang = row[\"Language\"]\n    angles = LANGUAGE_ANGLES[lang]\n    iso_pl, iso_ev = (\n        sspy.surveys.processing._adj_iso_pl(row[PAQ_IDS], angles, scale=4),\n        sspy.surveys.processing._adj_iso_ev(row[PAQ_IDS], angles, scale=4),\n    )\n    data.loc[i, \"ISOPleasant\"] = iso_pl\n    data.loc[i, \"ISOEventful\"] = iso_ev\n\ndata_list = [sspy.isd.select_location_ids(data, loc) for loc in data[\"LocationID\"].unique()]\nfig = sspy.plotting.create_circumplex_subplots(\n    data_list,\n    plot_type=\"density\",\n    nrows=6,\n    ncols=3,\n    figsize=(9, 18),\n    legend=True,\n    incl_scatter=True,\n    subtitles=[loc for loc in data[\"LocationID\"].unique()],\n    title=\"\",\n)\n\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plotting distribution density with empirical scatter\ndef empirical_msn_scatter(data, loc):\n    loc_msn = MultiSkewNorm()\n    loc_msn.fit(\n        data=data.query(f\"LocationID == '{loc}'\")[[\"ISOPleasant\", \"ISOEventful\"]]\n    )\n    loc_msn.sample(1000)\n    loc_Y = pd.DataFrame(loc_msn.sample_data, columns=[\"ISOPleasant\", \"ISOEventful\"])\n    return loc_Y\n\ndata_list = [empirical_msn_scatter(data, loc) for loc in data[\"LocationID\"].unique()]\n\nfig = sspy.plotting.create_circumplex_subplots(\n    data_list,\n    plot_type=\"density\",\n    nrows=6,\n    ncols=3,\n    figsize=(9, 18),\n    legend=True,\n    incl_scatter=True,\n    subtitles=[loc for loc in data[\"LocationID\"].unique()],\n    title=\"\",\n)\n\nfig.tight_layout()"

    "text": "1.3 The Soundscape Perception Index (SPI)\nThe SPI works by assessing the assessed (or calculated) distribution of soundscape responses against a target distribution. This target distribution represents the goal for the soundscape design. Since we consider a location’s soundscape perception to be the collective perception of its users, it is crucial that the target includes both the central tendency and the distribution.\n\n1.3.1 Note: Distributions in the circumplex\nWe should begin by discussing how soundscape circumplex distributions are defined. The circumplex is defined by two axes: P_{ISO} and E_{ISO} which are limited to the range [-1,1]. Typically the distribution of collective perception of a soundscape is also not symmetrical, therefore making it a skewed distribution. A soundscape distribution is thus a two-dimensional truncated skew-normal distribution.\nThe skew-normal distribution is defined by three parameters: location, scale and shape. The location parameter defines the centre of the distribution, the scale parameter defines the spread of the distribution, and the shape parameter defines the skew of the distribution. The skew-normal distribution is defined as:\n\nf(x; a, \\omega, \\alpha) = \\frac{2}{\\omega} \\phi \\left( \\frac{x-a}{\\omega} \\right) \\Phi \\left( \\alpha \\frac{x-a}{\\omega} \\right)\n\nwhere \\phi and \\Phi are the standard normal probability density function and cumulative distribution function respectively. The skew-normal distribution is thus a generalisation of the normal distribution, with the shape parameter \\alpha defining the skew. A positive shape parameter results in a right-skewed distribution, and a negative shape parameter results in a left-skewed distribution.\nTruncated skew-normal distribution: https://www-tandfonline-com.libproxy.ucl.ac.uk/doi/epdf/10.1080/03610910902936109?needAccess=true\nTo generate the truncated skew-normal distribution, we use rejection sampling. This is a method of generating a distribution by sampling from a simpler distribution and rejecting samples that do not fit the target distribution. In this case, we sample from a skew-normal distribution (scipy.stats.skewnorm) and reject samples that are outside of the range [-1,1].\n\n1.3.1.1 Example - Calculating the moments of location’s

A high SPI score does not necessarily mean that the soundscape is of high quality, but rather that the soundscape is of high quality according to the target.\nThe SPI_{bespoke} thus provides a method for scoring and ranking the success of a soundscape design against the designer’s goals.

    "text": "The EU Green Paper on Future Noise Policy indicates that 80 million EU citizens are suffering from potentially harmful environmental noise levels, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations (Berglund, Lindvall, and Schwela 1999). The publication of the EU Directive Relating to the Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise (END) (European Union 2002) more than two decades ago has led to major actions across Europe, with reducing noise levels as their main focus, for which billions of Euros are being spent. However, it is widely recognised that solely reducing sound level in people’s living environments is not always feasible or cost-effective and, more importantly, with only 30% of environmental noise annoyance depending on physical aspects of the signal such as acoustic energy (Guski 1997), sound level reduction will not necessarily lead to improved quality of life. For this reason, from a public health point of view, it is necessary to explore alternative management and design strategies for acoustic environments that rely on more positive soundscapes, rather than merely environments not affected by noise pollution (Aletta, Oberman, and Kang 2018; Kang 2023; Kang et al. 2023).\nSoundscape design, separate from (and complementary to) noise control engineering, is about the relationships between human physiology, perception, the sound environment, and its socio-cultural context (Kang 2006). Soundscape research represents a paradigm shift in that it combines physical, social, and psychological approaches and considers environmental sounds as a ‘resource’ rather than ‘waste’ (Kang and Schulte-Fortkamp 2016) relating to perceptual constructs rather than just physical phenomena. However, the current research is still at the stage of describing and identifying the problems and tends to be fragmented and focussed on only special cases e.g.~subjective evaluations of soundscapes for residential areas (Schulte-Fortkamp and Kang 2013; Chen and Kang 2023). In the movement from noise control to soundscape creation (Aletta and Kang 2015), a vital step is the standardisation of methods to assess soundscape quality.\nA common aim for implementing soundscape assessment in practice is to compare the quality of different soundscapes. Often (but not always) the goal is to identify a ‘good’ soundscape compared to a ‘bad’ soundscape. However, this presents several challenges:\n\nWhat makes a soundscape good or bad is highly contextual; that is, the same acoustic environment may result in different appreciations and perceptual outcomes, depending on where/when it is happening, and what groups of individuals are there to experience it.\nOn what metric should the quality rating be based? Previous attempts at defining objective metrics of “soundscape quality” assessment have fallen short of capturing the multidimensionality of people’s perception of surrounding acoustic environments.\nHow can we deal with different requirements and definitions of how a soundscape should be perceived? Soundscape constructs are normally seen as highly individualised, while designing the soundscapes of public spaces should look at accommodating the needs of a given community of a space as a whole.\n\nIn many cases, the ultimate aim is to be able to rank soundscapes based on their quality. There is pressure from stakeholders and policymakers to move towards such simplified assessment protocols. However, any ranking metric should be flexible and be able to handle a variety of contexts and definitions of what a `good’ soundscape is for a given purpose. To address this, we will propose the Soundscape Perception Index (SPI) framework, a flexible method for defining single value indices of soundscape quality based on distributions within the Soundscape Circumplex Model (SCM) (Östen Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2012; Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang 2022; Ö. Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2010). As previously suggested, the primary motivation behind the development of the Soundscape Perception Indices (SPI) framework stems from the need to address the existing gap in quantifying and comparing soundscape quality across diverse contexts and applications. By creating a unified framework for defining these indices, the aim is to is to empower stakeholders, decision-makers, and researchers with the ability to create tailored indices that align with their specific objectives and design goals, while simultaneously enabling cross-comparisons and benchmarking against empirically-defined reference soundscapes. This dual approach not only acknowledges the context-dependent nature of soundscape perception but also fosters a common language and understanding, facilitating knowledge sharing and collaborative efforts within the field. This paper will demonstrate the SPI framework and test whether it is capable of both scoring soundscape quality and generating consistent rankings of soundscapes across different contexts."

    "text": "2.1 Existing ‘Soundscape Indices’\nWhile the field of soundscape research has witnessed substantial progress, the development of standardized indices for evaluating and comparing soundscapes across diverse contexts has been relatively limited. Existing indices can be broadly seen as arising from two domains: soundscape ecology and soundscape perception.\n\n2.1.1 Soundscape Ecology and Bioacoustics\nWithin the realm of soundscape ecology, indices such as the Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI) and Frequency-dependent Acoustic Diversity Index (FADI) (Xu et al. 2023) have been developed to quantify the diversity and complexity of acoustic signals within a given soundscape. Similar indices (e.g. ADI, NDSI, ACI) have also been developed to analyse the acoustic signal of complex acoustic environments and indicate the richness and diversity of biophonic (natural) and anthrophonic (human-made) sound sources. However, while these indices contribute valuable insights into the ecological aspects of soundscapes, they do not directly address the perceptual dimensions that are central to the soundscape approach (Schulte-Fortkamp et al. 2023). The multi-dimensional nature of soundscape perception, encompassing factors such as pleasantness, eventfulness, and familiarity, necessitates a more comprehensive and context-sensitive approach.\n\n\n2.1.2 Soundscape Perception\nIn the domain of soundscape perception, several indices have emerged as attempts to quantify the perceived quality of soundscapes, particularly in urban environments.\nThe Green Soundscape Index (GSI) (Kogan et al. 2018) incorporates factors such as the presence and levels of natural sounds and human-made sounds, and their respective contributions to the overall soundscape perception. The GSI is defined as the ratio of the perceived extent of natural sounds (PNS) to the perceived extent of traffic noise (PTN), ranging between 1/5 and 5. Subsequently, Cao and colleagues (Cao, Meng, and Kang 2020; Yang, Cao, and Meng 2022) proposed the Red Soundscape Index (RSI), defined as the ratio of the perceived extent of human sounds to the perceived extent of either natural sounds (RSI_n) or traffic sounds (RSI_t), arguing that the GSI alone was not suitable for all urban soundscape design applications.\nBuilding on ecological diversity concepts, Liu et al. (2014) introduced the Soundscape Diversity Index (SDI), which quantifies the probability of two randomly selected sounds in a soundscape belonging to different categories, providing a measure of soundscape complexity. Expanding on this approach, Xiang et al. (2023) defined an expanded set of soundscape diversity indices, including the SDI, the Soundscape Richness Index (SRI), the Soundscape Dominance Index (SDO), and the Soundscape Evenness Index (SEI). These indices, adapted from species diversity measures in ecology, offer a more nuanced approach to quantifying aspects of soundscape perception. Xiang et al. (2023) demonstrated that these indices could be partially explained by existing acoustic indicators and were more suitable for evaluating urban green spaces than traditional acoustic indices.\nGuo et al. (2023) proposed the Harmonious Degree of Sound Sources (SHD) index, which combines perceived loudness, occurrence, and preference for sound sources. The SHD assess how well the dominance of a sound aligns with visitors’ preferences, aiming to reflect the harmonious status of sounds in a soundscape.\nIn 2019, Kang et al. (2019) proposed the development of a set of soundscape indices (SSID) which might take the form SSID = f(\\text{physical factors}) + f(\\text{contextual factors}) + \\ldots where the functions and weights of each aspect influencing soundscape perception (i.e. physical/acoustic parameters, contextual and visual factors, personal factors, etc.) could be derived statistically from a large dataset of soundscape surveys. The work presented here represents a development of this thinking which has grown out of the SSID project, where the analysis and indexing of perception data and the connection between soundscape indicators and perception have been separated (Mitchell et al. 2023). This modularization of perception prediction based on objective factors and soundscape index creation should enable more sophisticated and thoughtful index creation and more advanced and updateable prediction models.\nWhile these indices offer valuable insights into specific aspects of soundscape perception, they are limited in their ability to capture the full multidimensionality of soundscape experienve across diverse contexts. The Soundscape Perception Index (SPI) framework presented in this paper builds upon these efforts by providing a flexible, context-sensitive approach to soundscape assessment. Unlike many previous indices, the SPI is not an analysis of an acoustic signal but rather is an index of perception based on soundscape descriptors. Furthermore, it does not represent a single target in a particular context, but is a generalisable, extensible, and adaptable framework for scoring soundscapes against any goal defined by the user.\nThe remainder of the paper will introduce and demonstrate this framework, providing a case study of defining an appropriate target."

    "text": "3.1 Core Method\nSPI is grounded in the soundscape circumplex model (SCM) (Ö. Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2010; Östen Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2012), a robust theoretical foundation for understanding and representing the multi-dimensional nature of soundscape perception. The reason for grounding the SPI in the soundscape circumplex is that we have observed this model to become the most prevalent assessment model in soundscape literature (Aletta and Torresin 2023). The SCM is built on a series of descriptors referred to as the Perceived Affective Quality (PAQ), proposed by (Ö. Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2010). These PAQs are based on the pleasantness-eventfulness paradigm adopted in research on emotions and environmental psychology (and its original version, conceptualized as valence-arousal paradigm), in particular Russell’s circumplex model of affect (Russell 1980). As summarised by Ö. Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund (2010): “Russell’s model identifies two dimensions related to the perceived pleasantness of environments and how activating or arousing the environment is.”\nOne benefit of the circumplex model is that, as a whole, it encapsulates several of the other proposed soundscape descriptors - in particular, annoyance, pleasantness, tranquillity, and possibly restorativeness (Aletta, Kang, and Axelsson 2016). According to Ö. Axelsson (2015), the two-dimensional circumplex model of perceived affective quality provides the most comprehensive information for soundscape assessment. It is also possible that the overall soundscape quality could itself be derived from the pleasant-eventful scores derived for a soundscape. The circumplex also lends itself well to questionnaire-based methods of data collection, as proposed in ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018). In contrast to methods such as soundwalks, interviews, and lab experiments, questionnaires are able to provide the quality and amount of data which is necessary for statistical modelling. Combined, these factors make the circumplex most appropriate for a single index as it provides a comprehensive summary of soundscape perception.\nThere are four steps involved in calculating the SPI, as shown in Figure 1:\n\nDefine and parameterise the target circumplex distribution;\nSample the target distribution and prepare the test distribution;\nCompare test and target distributions using the distance metric (two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance D_{BKS});\nCalculate SPI = 100 * (1 - D_{BKS}).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Steps for calculating the SPI.\n\n\n\nThese steps and their required background are discussed in detail in the following sections. Section 4.2.1 will then present strategies for defining targets and their applications. Throughout this paper, we use the data contained in the International Soundscape Database (ISD) (Mitchell et al. 2024), which includes 1300+ individual responses on the PAQ scales collected across 13 locations in London and Venice, according to the SSID Protocol (Mitchell et al. 2020)."

    "text": "3.2 Define and Parameterise a Soundscape Circumplex Distribution\nTo move the eight-item PAQ responses into the two-dimensional circumplex space, we use the projection method first presented in ISO/TS 12913-3:2018 (ISO/TS 12913-3:2019 2019). This projection method and its associated formulae were recently updated further in Aletta et al. (2024) to include a correction for the language in which the survey was conducted. Aletta et al. (2024) also provides adjusted angles for translations of the circumplex attributes to be used in calculating the P_{ISO} and E_{ISO} coordinates. Once the individual perceptual responses are projected into the circumplex space, the resulting data for each location is treated as a circumplex distribution. There are several advancements in considering circumplex distributions compared to the discussions originally given in Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang (2022) which are necessary for SPI. Before exploring the SPI method and target setting more specifically, we will first address these developments.\nThe circumplex is defined by two axes: P_{ISO} and E_{ISO}, which are limited to the range [-1, +1]. Typically, data in the soundscape circumplex is treated as a combination of two independent normal distributions, one for each axis (Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang 2022; Ooi et al. 2022). In some applications this approach is sufficient for capturing the distribution of soundscape perception, however defining a target distribution for SPI requires a more precise approach. The independent normal distribution approach relies on three key assumptions:\n\nThe two axes are normally distributed.\nThe two axes are symmetrically distributed.\nThe two axes are independent of each other.\n\nWhile the first assumption is generally valid, the second and third assumptions are not always met in practice. In particular, the distribution of soundscape perception responses in the circumplex is often characterised by a high degree of skewness, which can lead to inaccuracies in the calculation of the SPI. Soundscape circumplex distributions are most appropriately described as a bivariate skew-normal distribution (Adelchi Azzalini 2005) which accurately reflects the relationship between the two dimensions of the circumplex and the fact that real-world perceptual distributions have been consistently observed to not be strictly symmetric.\nThe skew-normal distribution is defined by three parameters: location (\\mu), scale (\\sigma), and shape (\\alpha). The location parameter defines the centre of the distribution, the scale parameter defines the spread of the distribution and the shape parameter defines the skew of the distribution. The one-dimensional skew-normal distribution is defined as (A. Azzalini and Valle 1996):\n\n\\phi(z; \\alpha) = 2 \\phi(z) \\Phi(\\alpha z) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad z \\in \\mathbb{R}\n\nwhere \\phi and \\Phi are the standard normal probability density function and distribution function, respectively, and \\alpha is a shape variable which regulates the skewness. The distribution reduces to a standard normal density when \\alpha = 0. The bivariate skew-normal distribution extends this concept to two dimensions, allowing for the modelling of asymmetric and skewed distributions in a two-dimensional space such as the soundscape circumplex. The multivariate skew-normal (MSN) distribution including scale and location parameters is given by combining the normal density and distribution functions (A. Azzalini and Capitanio 1999):\n\nY = 2 \\phi_k (y-\\xi; \\Omega) \\Phi\\{\\alpha^T\\omega^{-1}(y-\\xi)\\}\n\nwhere \\phi_k is the k-dimensional normal density with location \\xi, shape \\alpha, and covariance matrix \\Omega. \\Phi \\{ \\dot \\} is the normal distribution function and \\alpha is a k-dimensional shape vector. When \\alpha = 0, Y reduces to the standard multivariate normal N_k(\\xi, \\Omega) density. A circumplex distribution can therefore be parameterised1 with a 2x2 covariance matrix \\Omega, a 2x1 location vector \\xi, and a 2x1 shape vector \\alpha, written as:\n\nY \\sim MSN (\\xi, \\Omega, \\alpha)\n\nBy fitting an MSN distribution to empirical soundscape perception responses, it becomes possible to accurately capture the asymmetry and skewness of the distribution. A bivariate skew-normal distribution can be summarised as a set of these three parameters. Once parameterised, the distribution can then be sampled from to generate a synthetic distribution of soundscape perception responses.\nSoundscape targets can thus be set by defining the desired MSN distribution. To demonstrate this, we will construct three arbitrary targets which will be used later to score three SPIs. The parameters chosen for the example targets are given in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1: The MSN direct parameterizations for three arbitrary example target distributions. \\text{tgt}_1 is located in the pleasant half, with a wide variance, and a positive skew along the pleasantness axis. \\text{tgt}_2 is located in the calm quadrant, with a typical variance, and a negative skew along the pleasantness axis and a positive skew along the eventful axis. \\text{tgt}_3 is located in the vibrant quadrant, with a moderate variance, and a negative skew along the eventfulness axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\nLocation \\xi\nCovariance Matrix \\Omega\nShape \\alpha\n\n\n\n\n\\text{tgt}_1\n[0.5, 0.0]\n\\begin{bmatrix} 0.2 & 0.0 \\\\ 0.0 & 0.2 \\end{bmatrix}\n[1, 0]\n\n\n\\text{tgt}_2\n[1.0, -0.4]\n\\begin{bmatrix} 0.18 & -0.04 \\\\ -0.04 & 0.09 \\end{bmatrix}\n[-8, 1]\n\n\n\\text{tgt}_3\n[0.5, 0.7]\n\\begin{bmatrix} 0.1 & 0.05 \\\\ 0.05 & 0.1 \\end{bmatrix}\n[0, -5]"

    "text": "3.4 Compare the target and test soundscape assessment distributions\nCentral to the SPI framework is the concept of a distance metric, which quantifies the deviation of a given soundscape from a desired target soundscape. This distance metric serves as the basis for calculating the SPI value, with smaller distances indicating a closer alignment between the perceived soundscape and the target soundscape perception. The distance between the test and target soundscape distributions is calculated using a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance D_{BKS}} (Fasano and Franceschini 1987). The KS distance is a non-parametric metric of the equality of continuous distributions which is sensitive to both the location and shape of the distributions (Chakravati, Laha, and Roy 1967).\nEssentially, we approach this as a problem of (dis)similarity between soundscapes. The D_{BKS} distance metric is then proposed to assess how similar any two given soundscapes distributions are within the circumplex. Taken to the extreme, two perfectly matching distributions in the soundscape circumplex would return a 100% SPI value, while two completely dissimilar distributions would return a 0% SPI value. In practical terms, for the former, this will never be achieved in real world scenarios; for the latter, it is also difficult to estimate how low the SPI value could actually go, and it should be considered that the distance may happen in different directions within the circumplex space. For instance, if a distribution for a vibrant soundscape was taken as a reference, a compared soundscape distribution may exhibit low SPI values for being located in the calm, OR monotonous, OR chaotic regions of the model.\nUsing the data from one location in the ISD (Piazza San Marco) as the test distribution, the D_{BKS} statistic is calculated for each of the target distributions defined above, shown in Table 2 and (fig?)–targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Kolmogorov-Smirnov test comparing the empirical test distribution (Piazza San Marco) against three soundscape target distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\nD\n      p\n\n\n\n\ntgt_1\n0.66\n6.94745e-25\n\n\ntgt_2\n0.83\n8.96388e-39\n\n\ntgt_3\n0.28\n8.96388e-39"

Bespoke targets are tailor-made for specific projects, reflecting the desired soundscape perception for a particular application. These targets can be defined by stakeholders, designers, policymakers, or decision-makers based on their unique requirements, objectives, and constraints. This flexibility allows the SPI for a specific project to be tailored to the desire of the stakeholders for how that specific soundscape should function. It can also provide a consistent and quantifiable baseline for scenarios like a soundscape design contest wherein a target is specified and provided to all participants in the contest and the winning proposal is the design with the highest SPI score when assessed against that target. Stakeholders could use various methods to decide on a target, subject to the requirements of their project or use case. For example, it could be co-created with other stakeholders or space users, based on trying to match the soundscape of a previous project, or entirely arbitrary."

    "section": "4.2 Reference Targets",
    "text": "4.2 Reference Targets\nIn contrast to bespoke targets, reference targets represent generalized, widely recognized soundscape archetypes which transcend specific applications or projects. These archetypes serve as reference points and enable comparisons across different domains and use cases. Essentially a reference target is a target that has been empirically defined to encapsulate the ideal of a particular type of soundscape (e.g. for a park, for an urban square, for a particular group of users, etc.).\n\n4.2.1 Deriving a target based on a priori rankings\nAbsent from the above methodology has been an exploration of how to actually arrive at a target based on empirical evidence; i.e., not a target specified ad hoc, but rather an “absolute” target, based on type of space, use case, or similar. While arbitrary targets make the SPI framework incredibly flexible, able to score against an effectively infinite set of design goals, often targets should have some sort of systematic foundation, especially when defining a Reference Target. To enable this approach, we therefore present one method of systematically deriving a target distribution based on a given ranking of soundscape quality. Just as one primary goal of the SPI framework is to enable soundscape rankings to be produced from SPI scores, this method allows for rankings which were arrived at separately to produce an optimised SPI target.\nThe core challenge in developing a reference SPI target is determining what constitutes an “ideal” soundscape perception distribution for a given context. While we can directly specify MSN parameters to create bespoke targets based on theoretical expectations or design goals, developing empirically-grounded reference targets requires a more systematic approach.\nTo enable this approach, we therefore present one method of systematically deriving a target distribution based on a given ranking of soundscape quality. The a priori ranking serves as a bridge between existing knowledge about soundscape quality and the mathematical framework of the SPI. By starting with a ranking of soundscapes whose relative quality has been assessed through some external measure, we can use optimization techniques to derive MSN parameters that:\n\nWhen used as an SPI target, produce scores that result in the same ranking order\nGenerate high SPI scores for the highly-ranked soundscapes\nDefine a distribution in the circumplex space that captures the perceptual characteristics common to high-quality soundscapes in this context.\n\nThis approach allows us to work backwards from known good (and poor) examples to define what the target distribution should look like. For instance, if we know that location A has a better soundscape than location B for our purposes, the optimal target distribution should result in location A receiving a higher SPI score than location B.\nIn this case study, we will examine a possible ranking from the ISD park locations produced by the authors (shown in Table 4).\n\n\n\nTable 4: A pre-defined ranking of soundscape quality of the park locations included in the International Soundscape Database (ISD). An SPI target will be derived which aims to reproduce this same ranking when applied to circumplex data from these locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nRank\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n1\nRegentsParkJapan\n\n\n2\nRegentsParkFields\n\n\n3\nCampoPrincipe\n\n\n4\nMonumentoGaribaldi\n\n\n5\nRussellSq\n\n\n6\nMiradorSanNicolas\n\n\n7\nStPaulsCross\n\n\n8\nNoorderplantsoen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectively, this is an optimisation task to determine the MSN parameters which best achieve the above goals. Parameter optimisation refers to the process of adjusting the parameters of a system, model, or algorithm to achieve the best possible performance according to one or more objectives. To set up the optimisation task, we first need to express the parameter space and any constraints. Since our goal is to identify an optimised soundscape target distribution, the parameters we will search over are:\n\n\\xi = (\\xi_x, \\xi_y), -1 \\leq \\xi \\leq 1\n\\Omega = \\begin{pmatrix} var(x) & cov(x, y) \\\\ cov(y, x) & var(y) \\end{pmatrix}\n\n0 \\leq var() \\leq 1\n-1 \\leq cov() \\leq 1\n\\Omega must be symmetric and positive definite\n\n\\alpha = (\\alpha_x, \\alpha_y), -5 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 5\n\nWe then define the objective functions based on the two goals given above. For each step in the algorithm with a given trial set of parameters, a target distribution will be produced, the SPI for each test location assessed according to the protocol described in Section 3, and the resulting set of SPI scores and ranking will be scored using the objective functions. Goal (1) is assessed by calculating the Spearman rank correlation between the a priori ranking and the SPI ranking:\n\nf_1 = r_{s}(R(\\text{prior}), R(\\text{target}))\n\nGoal (2) is scored by calculating a weighted sum of the produced SPIs. To prioritise a target which provides high SPI scores for highly ranked soundscapes, we weight according to the ranking position:\n\nf_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{1}{\\text{rank}_i} \\cdot SPI_i\n\nwhere m is the number of included locations, SPI_i is the calculated SPI score for the i-th location assessed against a trial target, and \\text{rank}_i is the calculated rank value of the i-th location.\nThrough our testing, optimising only on the rank correlation regularly produced targets which, while they did result in the desired ranking, were in no way representative of the soundscapes in question. We therefore aim to optimise for both a consistent soundscape ranking and for a high SPI score for the top-ranked soundscapes. Optimising these parameters with respect to multiple objectives ensures a more holistic approach to system improvement, acknowledging the trade-offs and interactions between different goals.\nWe apply the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) (Deb et al. 2002) to optimise our target distribution parameters. NSGA-II is a popular and efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that is well-suited for problems with multiple, potentially conflicting objectives.\nThe algorithm works as follows2:\n\nInitialize a population of candidate solutions, each representing a set of target distribution parameters (\\xi, \\Omega, \\alpha).\nEvaluate each candidate solution using the two objective functions defined above.\nPerform non-dominated sorting to rank the solutions based on Pareto dominance.\nCalculate crowding distance for each solution to maintain diversity in the population.\nSelect parent solutions using tournament selection based on non-domination rank and crowding distance.\nCreate offspring solutions using crossover and mutation operators, ensuring that the constraints on the parameters are maintained.\nCombine parent and offspring populations and select the best solutions to form the next generation.\nRepeat steps 2-7 for a specified number of generations or until a termination criterion is met.\n\nThe NSGA-II algorithm is implemented using the Python library pymoo v0.6.1.3 (Blank and Deb 2020). The population size is set to 150, and the algorithm runs for 100 generations. In pymoo, each objective function is supposed to be minimised, so when implementing the algorithm and in the results, -f_1 and -f_2 are used. After running the NSGA-II algorithm, we obtain a set of non-dominated solutions representing the Pareto front, shown in Figure 3 (a). Each solution on the Pareto front represents a trade-off between the two objectives: maximising the rank correlation (f_1) and maximising the weighted sum of SPI scores (f_2). The Pareto front allows us to visualise and analyse the range of possible solutions, from those that prioritise ranking consistency to those that emphasise high-SPI scores for top-ranked soundscapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Multi-objective optimization Pareto front. The selected solution is indicated in red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) SCM distribution of the derived target distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: NSGA-II optimization to learn the MSN parameters which produce the Park ranking.\n\n\n\nSource: Supplementary Material for: Soundscape Perception Indices (SPI) \nFor this demonstration, we opt for the second method, selecting the solution closest to the ideal point in the normalised objective space. This approach provides a balance between ranking consistency and high SPI scores for top-ranked soundscapes. Once the optimal solution is selected, we can sample from the MSN distribution and plot the derived target distribution, shown in Figure 3.\n\n\\textup{tgt}_{\\textup{park}} \\sim  \\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\n    \\xi&=&[0.694, 0.406] \\\\\n    \\Omega&=&\\begin{bmatrix}\n        0.157 & 0.040 \\\\\n        0.040 & 0.255\n    \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n    \\alpha&=&[5.054, -37.671]\n\\end{matrix}\\right.\n\nThe resulting \\text{tgt}_{\\text{park}}, with the MSN parameters given above, exhibits some expected characteristics: it is almost entirely pleasant, with a long uneventful tail into the calm quadrant, but somewhat unexpectedly the mode is slightly vibrant. What should be made clear about this demonstration is that we are not presenting this as a reference target to be used in the future - this section is meant as a demonstration of a method which can be used to derive a target from an a priori ranking. In this case, the a priori ranking was created by the authors from their experience of the locations in the ISD. To truly be called an empirical reference target, the ranking would need to be arrived at empirically, via some other metric (e.g. health or productivity ratings of the areas) or through an experiment such as paired-choice comparisons.\nIt is these reference targets with an empirical backing which would ideally form agreed upon standards and benchmarks in the field against which new soundscapes would be compared. The best methods for empirically determining the ideal soundscape distribution for a given context will no doubt remain a topic of debate and development in the coming years."

    "section": "5.1 Applications of the SPI framework",
    "text": "5.1 Applications of the SPI framework\nThe proposed framework offers several key advantages. First, it acknowledges the inherent context-dependent nature of soundscape perception, allowing for the creation of indices tailored to specific use cases or design goals through the use of bespoke targets. This flexibility ensures that the resulting SPIs accurately capture the desired soundscape perception for the given application, enabling targeted interventions and optimisations.\nSecond, the inclusion of reference targets facilitates cross-comparisons and benchmarking, enabling a common language and understanding of soundscape quality across different domains. By calculating the distance between a given soundscape and these widely recognized references, stakeholders can identify areas for improvement and prioritize interventions accordingly, aligning their efforts with collectively recognized standards of desirable or undesirable soundscapes.\nWe expect that this would then expand into collections of SPI targets. As an example, imagine trying to define a soundscape perception index that could be applied across an entire city. A single index is insufficient, because each type of place within the city (e.g. parks, plazas, residential areas) has different requirements for its soundscape. Therefore, each place type would need its own soundscape target.\nIn this example, these sets of targets would correspond to different types of places within the city (e.g. a single target for parks, a target for plazas etc.). When applying this “urban typology” set of targets, the soundscape of each location being assessed would be scored against its relevant target (i.e how well does a specific park perform in comparison to a reference park target). This results in a single score for each location that can be compared against all other locations, regardless of whether or not they are the same type of place, allowing for different soundscapes to be compared on a common scale. This system ensures that context (in this case, the typology of a space) is brought into the assessment, allowing soundscapes to be scored against the most appropriate target. Enabling these context dependent assessments to be expressed on a common scale can facilitate additional use cases such as soundscape mapping, which requires a single scale to be applied across an entire city.\nThis set of targets made up of e.g. parks, plazas etc. is just one example of an application of reference SPIs. Other examples could include a demographics SPI, where different targets are set for respondents from different demographic groups, or a “use case” SPI with different targets set for different intended purposes of spaces (e.g. recreation, restoration, socialising). We encourage users of the SPI to define both their own single reference targets that can be added these suites of targets for use by others, and their own new sets of reference.\n(Kogan et al. 2018, fig. 6), in fact displays a startlingly similar concept, showing the locations of the three categories of traffic noise dominance (‘traffic noise’, ‘balanced’, and ‘natural’) plotted in the circumplex perceptual model. It can be clearly seen in this plot that the GSI categories create their own clusters within the circumplex.\nAlthough it is expected that the target distribution would usually represent the ideal or goal soundscape perception, it is also possible to define target distributions that represent undesirable or suboptimal soundscape perceptions. For instance, in a soundscape mapping context, it may be beneficial to map and identify chaotic soundscapes across a city in order to better target areas for soundscape interventions. In this case, the target distribution would be set in the chaotic quadrant and a higher SPI would indicate a closer alignment with the target distribution. This flexibility allows the SPI to be applied to a wide range of contexts and applications, enabling the quantification and comparison of soundscape quality across diverse scenarios."

    "text": "5.2 Connecting with soundscape data\nUnlike previous soundscape indices (see Section 2.1), SPI does not include any direct connection to soundscape indicators such as the sound level, spectral content, etc. Its basis in perceptual descriptor data effective allows the analysis and quantification of soundscape information to be modularised, separating the task of calculating a single index from the complex task of predicting soundscape perception from objective data. The modularisation of soundscape data analysis allows the entire pipeline from environmental data collection through to soundscape index scoring to remain flexible. Following the soundscape engineering paradigm laid out in Mitchell et al. (2023), the connection between soundscape indicators, through descriptors, to indices can be made by predictive soundscape models. These models are trained on increasingly large scale datasets and generally designed to predict soundscape descriptors, including the SCM attributes Hou et al. (2024). With the complex and multidimensional nature of soundscape perception and with the rapid progression in machine learning techniques and applications, an index framework should be able to integrate new and improved models. By separating the prediction of perceptual descriptors based on objective metrics from the calculation of the single value index itself, the SPI framework allows for these predictive models and for the creation of new indices to advance independently."

    "section": "5.3 Comparison with existing soundscape indices",
    "text": "5.3 Comparison with existing soundscape indices\nThe SPI framework represents a unique approach to soundscape assessment, building upon and differentiating itself from previous indices in several key ways. Firstly, the SPI framework is fundamentally perception-focused. By referring to the “Soundscape Perception Index”, we aim to highlight the unique and perception-focussed nature of this index framework. The SPI core method operates entirely within the perception data space, with no direct reference to acoustic or other indicators. Perceptual data (or predicted perceptual data) are the only operant factors of the SPI method. The aim of SPI is to combine multidimensional perception data and context (including design goals) into a single metric.\nThe SPI framework shares this important characteristic with indices like the Soundscape Diversity Index (SDI) (Liu et al. 2014) and the Harmonious Degree of Sound Sources (SHD) (Guo et al. 2023) in that they all prioritize perception as the primary input for assessment. Both SDI and SHD, however, focus on the perception of sound sources that can be observed in an acoustic environment, and their relationships. While these indices offer valuable insights into specific aspects of soundscape perception, they are somewhat limited in their scope and adaptability. The SPI framework builds upon these efforts by incorporating the full dimensionality of the soundscape circumplex model and allowing for context-sensitive assessments through bespoke and reference targets. This approach enables the SPI to address a wider range of soundscape evaluation needs while maintaining the crucial focus on perceptual data that distinguishes these methods from purely acoustic measurements.\nFurthermore, the SPI framework is designed to be generalisable, extensible, and adaptable. Unlike previous indices that often represent a single target in a particular context, the SPI framework allows for scoring soundscapes against any goal defined by the user. This flexibility makes it applicable across a wide range of contexts and design objectives, from urban planning and acoustic design to research and policy development."

    "section": "5.4 Considerations and future work",
    "text": "5.4 Considerations and future work\nSeveral considerations should be noted when defining an SPI target. First, the target distribution should be representative of the desired soundscape perception for the given application. This requires a clear understanding of the context, objectives, and constraints of the project, as well as the preferences and expectations of stakeholders and end-users. Second, the temporal and spatial scales of the target distribution should align with the soundscape assessment being conducted. What constitutes the actual spatial bounds of ‘a soundscape’, or indeed of ‘a place’, is a complex question which will depend on the context of the assessment. For example, a park soundscape may be defined by the boundaries of the park itself, or it may extend to include the surrounding urban environment or be restricted to a certain distance from a feature of interest in the park3. The temporal scale of the assessment is also important, as soundscape quality can vary throughout the day and across different seasons. Increasing the spatial bounds of what is considered the soundscape under examination (e.g. a single position vs a 25m^2 area vs an entire park) or extending the temporal scale will almost certainly result in a distribution with a larger variance. What scales are appropriate for a given assessment will depend on the context and objectives of the project, but they should be considered when defining the target distribution. Applying a target distribution that is too broad or too narrow for the context of the assessment may result in inaccurate or misleading SPI scores. As the circumplex distribution first described in Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang (2022) and further formalised here develops, we are hopeful that a better understanding of the relationship between temporal and spatial scales and the parameters of the distribution will emerge and will contribute to an increased understanding of what constitutes `the soundscape of a place’ and how this should be reflected in its ideal perception distribution.\nVarious other distance metrics were considered when developing the SPI method. The simplest method is to define a single point target, rather than a target distribution, and calculate a normalized mean Euclidean distance between points in the test distribution and the target point. While this is conceptually simple and requires defining only a single coordinate point as a target, rather than the MSN parameters described in Section 3.2, the shape and spread of a soundscape distribution is itself an important factor in describing the collective perception of a soundscape and would not be captured by this method (Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang 2022).\nAn additional method which was considered, was to consider a target as an ellipse (or, indeed any other shape) drawn in the circumplex space (similar to the simplified median decile curves proposed in Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang (2022)). An SPI score would then be calculated based on the percentage of responses which fall within the space defined by the ellipse. Again, this is conceptually quite simple and defining the ellipse targets is straightforward. However, this method has an important flaw - it is easy to artificially inflate or deflate the scores merely by changing the area of the ellipse. The larger the ellipse, the higher all SPI scores will be, regardless of whether the sample distribution is wide or narrow. This would also limit cross-comparability between targets. As can be seen in Table 3, defining a target distribution with a larger spread (i.e. \\text{tgt}_1) does not automatically result in higher SPI scores across the board as it would with the ellipse target method. By defining the SPI as a true target-test distribution comparison we ensure that the SPI always accurately reflects the similarity between the perception of a soundscape and its target, both in terms of its location in the circumplex and the shape of the data.\nAs noted in Section 4.2.1, although a methodology for deriving targets is presented, the a priori ranking we use for the demonstration was not itself arrived at empirically. Hence the park target cannot be considered a true reference target. A key piece of future work is to use experimental methods such as paired-choice comparisons to arrive at a well-defined ranking which can then produce a true reference target."

    "text": "Methods for collecting data on how people experience acoustic environments have been at the forefront of the debate in soundscape studies for the past 20 years. While the soundscape research field as we understand it today dates back to the late 1960s with the pioneering work of authors like M. Southworth (Southworth 1969), R.M. Schafer (Schafer 1977), and H. Westerkamp (Westerkamp 2002), the theme of data collection methods for soundscape assessment emerged more prominently only recently (Kang et al. 2016). There is a general consensus in the research community that standardised tools to gather and report individual responses on the perception of urban acoustic environments are indeed desirable, to provide comparable datasets and soundscape characterisations across different locations, times, and samples of people, as well as allowing for replicability studies, and offering inputs for modelling algorithms in soundscape prediction and design tasks. These were among the main drivers for the establishment of a Working Group at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) back in 2008, which was named “Perceptual assessment of soundscape quality” (ISO/TC 43/SC 1/WG 54) that has so far published three documents within the ISO 12913 series on soundscape. Part 1 (ISO 12913-1:2014) is a full standard and provides a general framework and definitions of soundscape concepts (ISO 2014), while Part 2 (ISO/TS 12913-2:2018) and Part 3 (ISO/TS 12913-3:2019) are technical specifications and offer guidance on how data should be collected and analysed, accordingly (ISO 2018, 2019) (Part 4, on soundscape design interventions, is currently under development by the working group, also registered as a technical specifications document). Specifically, Part 3 presents the proposed methods for analysing and representing the data collected by the soundscape surveys. Since the development of these standards, the focus has shifted from understanding individual perception to characterising the collective perception of increasingly large groups.\nIn a recent editorial paper on Soundscape Assessment, Axelsson and colleagues observe that it is important to critically discuss current theories and models in soundscape studies and to examine their effectiveness, while also looking at how to integrate different methods and perspectives for the discipline to make further advancements (Axelsson, Guastavino, and Payne 2019). This work was mainly aimed at addressing the issue of meaningful comparability and representation of soundscape assessments. Part 2 of the ISO 12913 standard itself does not provide ultimate answers: the technical specifications recommend multiple methods, as consensus around a single protocol could not be reached. This diversity of methodological approaches should be interpreted as a fact that soundscape theory is still under development and, for this reason, the standardisation work should probably take a step back and focus on developing a reference method for comparability among soundscape studies, rather than a single protocol for soundscape data collection. Some attempts have indeed already been made in literature for the different methods proposed in the ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 Jo, Seo, and Jeon (2020). Neither the standard nor the general soundscape literature has settled on effective methods of analysing and representing the data that results from these protocols. Data visualisations are particularly important for understanding and communicating information as multifaceted as soundscape perception (Tufte 2001). Although it is unlikely that any single method will be sufficient, attempts should be made to both facilitate future advancements in this realm and to develop a first step approach that captures the inherent uncertainty in perception studies, since including uncertainty is considered one of the core principles of good data visualisation (Midway 2020).\nThis study thus aims to review the consequences of these methods for larger datasets and provide concrete examples for how soundscapes should be represented. In particular, we aim to strengthen the practices for characterising the soundscape of a location, as a collective perception by the users of the location. We also demonstrate how the progress of these tools from their initial scope (measuring and discussing the individual perception of a soundwalk participant) have not kept up with recent advances and requirements for larger-scale soundscape datasets. We question whether there are some issues related to the data collection instruments and data analysis methods as recommended and examine the results of the model framework and mathematical transformations laid out in the ISO technical specifications to guide the interpretation of the soundscape circumplex.\nTo examine these tools and the questions raised, we apply them to an existing large scale, real-world dataset of soundscape assessments collected according to the ISO methods. Finally, we propose a more holistic and advanced method of representing soundscapes as a probabilistic distribution of perceptions within the circumplex and provide a toolbox for others to use."

    "text": "2.1 Coordinate transformation into the two primary dimensions\nTo facilitate the analysis of the PA responses, the Likert scale responses are coded from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree) as ordinal variables. In order to reduce the 8 PA values into a pair of coordinates which can be plotted on the Pleasant-Eventful axes, Part 3 of ISO 12913 (ISO 2019) provides a trigonometric transformation, based on the 45\\circ-relationship between the diagonal axes and the pleasant and eventful axes. This transformation projects the coded values from the individual PAs down onto the primary Pleasantness and Eventfulness dimensions then adds them together to form a single coordinate pair. In theory, this coordinate pair then encapsulates information from all 8 PA dimensions onto a more easily understandable and analysable two dimensions. The ISO coordinates are thus calculated by:\n\n\\begin{split}\n    ISO Pleasant = [(pleasant - annoying) + \\cos 45\\circ * (calm - chaotic) \\\\ + \\cos 45\\circ * (vibrant - monotonous)] * 1/(4+\\sqrt{32)}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{1}\n\n\\begin{split}\n    ISO Eventful = [(eventful - uneventful) + \\cos 45\\circ * (chaotic - calm) \\\\ + \\cos 45\\circ * (vibrant - monotonous)] * 1/(4+\\sqrt{32)}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2}\nwhere the PAs are arranged around the circumplex as shown in Figure 1. The \\cos 45\\circ term operates to project the diagonal terms down onto the x and y axes, and the 1 / (4 + \\sqrt{32}) scales the resulting coordinates to the range (-1, 1). The result of this transformation is demonstrated in Figure 1. This treatment of the 8 PAs makes several assumptions and inferences about the relationships between the dimensions. As stated in the standard (ISO 2019, 5):\n\nAccording to the two-dimensional model, vibrant soundscapes are both pleasant and eventful, chaotic soundscapes are both eventful and unpleasant, monotonous soundscapes are both unpleasant and uneventful, and finally calm soundscapes are both uneventful and pleasant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example of representations of two soundscape assessments.

In order to characterise the soundscape of a particular space or time, perceptual responses from multiple people must be collected and subsequently summarised or aggregated to describe the general soundscape of the location. The ISO guidelines stipulate a minimum of 20 participants for a soundwalk, with these broken up into sessions of no more than 5 participants at a time. Part 3 then provides the recommended methods for analysing this data.\nAnnex A.2 of ISO 12913 Part 3 provides the statistical measures to be used on the raw PA responses. The recommended measure of central tendency is the median, while the recommended measure of dispersion is the range. These are chosen as the data is ordinal by nature, however as will be demonstrated later, they have significant limitations. Although it is unclear, the implied intention is then that the median value of each PA is fed into Equation 1 and Equation 2 presented above to calculate the ISOPleasant and ISOEventful values, which can then be plotted in a two-dimensional scatter plot. Thus the standard suggests that 1) the projection method equations are not applied to individual responses and 2) only the median assessment of a location should be plotted."

    "section": "2.3 Limitations of the ISO",
    "text": "2.3 Limitations of the ISO\nHow these methods should be applied to represent the soundscape of a location has not been adequately discussed in previous literature, nor sufficiently in Part 3 of ISO 1293 itself. Indeed, in Section A.3, the technical specifications document state that (ISO 2019, 5):\n\nResults can be reported in a two-dimensional scatter plot with coordinates for the two dimensions ‘pleasantness’ and ‘eventfulness’. The coordinates for ‘pleasantness’ are plotted on the X-axis, and the coordinates for ‘eventfulness’ on the Y-axis. Every data point in the scatter plot represents one investigated site.\n\nHowever, it is not made clear whether this single point on the circumplex can be considered to be a realistic representation of the average perception of the acoustic environment. Effectively, there is no representation of dispersion in the soundscape assessment, nor a recommended use of the range that was calculated as part of the analysis recommend in Section A.2 of Part 3 of the ISO 12913. Absent a suggestion from the ISO 12913 for how the range should be used, we therefore apply this analysis to an existing real-world soundscape dataset to determine whether it provides a useful measure of dispersion. Here we use the data contained in the International Soundscape Database (ISD) (Mitchell, Oberman, Aletta, Erfanian, et al. 2021), which includes 1,300+ individual responses collected across 13 locations in London and Venice, according to the SSID Protocol, which is based on the ISO methods explored in this paper (Mitchell et al. 2020).\nFor any large enough sample for a site, the range will always be from 1 to 5, the maximum and minimum available Likert-scale values. We would expect that collecting more data would result in more information or better precision, however the range will always increase as the sample size increases. As an example, within the ISD data, of the 8 PAs collected at 13 locations (for a total of 104 scales), 88% have a range from 1 to 5 and with larger sample sizes at each location, this percentage would only have increased. Using range to analyse the dispersion provides very limited information for comparing the soundscape assessments of different locations, or of a location under different conditions.\nAlthough the range does not appear to be a useful measure of dispersion, the median does provide a useful measure and appropriately functions to describe the central tendency of the soundscape assessment of the sample. However, by stipulating that the median of each PA should be taken prior to applying the circumplex projection, the ISO procedure only allows for plotting a single scatter point in the circumplex for each location and does not allow for plotting individual responses on the circumplex. This limits the possibilities for visualising the general trends in individual perception across the soundscape. Finally, no example or recommendation for how the circumplex scatter plot should be presented is given in the standard.\nThe instruments described in the ISO 12913 Part 2 (ISO 2018) were originally designed primarily for the context of individual or small group assessments. In these scenarios, the focus is on assessing the particular soundscape perception of the person in question. Recent advances in the soundscape approach since the development of the standards have shifted some focus from individual soundscapes to characterising the overall soundscape of public spaces (Mitchell et al. 2020) and to making comparisons between different groups of people (Jeon et al. 2018). In this context, a consideration of the natural variation in people’s perception and the variation over time of a soundscape must be a core feature of how the soundscape is discussed. Reducing a public space which may have between tens and tens of thousands of people moving through it in a single day down to the mean (or median, or any other single metric) soundscape assessment often dismisses the reality of the space. Likewise, this overall soundscape of a public space cannot be determined through a ten person soundwalk, as there is no guarantee that the sample of people engaged in the soundwalk is representative of the users of the space (in fact it is likely they would not be)."

    "text": "4.1 Limitations of the circumplex and quantitative analysis\nThe method presented here is a solution for representing the soundscape of a space, which requires considering the perception of many people, but it is important to note that this is only one (very important) goal of the soundscape approach. Psychological and sociological investigations of people’s relationship to their sound environment and the interactions between social contexts and individual perception are a crucial aspect of the field for which this approach would likely not be sufficient (Bild et al. 2018). Open-response questions, structured interviews, and mixed-methods studies can provide additional insight into how people experience their environment and should be considered alongside or preceding this focus on how a space is likely to be perceived on a larger scale.\nThese other approaches are not in opposition to the methods proposed here, but instead further expand our view. The circumplex is a limited view of soundscape perception (this is made obvious by the fact that it excludes the third component, familiarity, identified in Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund (2010)) but it is an exceptionally rich tool for dealing with the two primary aspects of soundscape perception which can readily expand the much more limited view provided by existing noise and annoyance assessment tools. Aspects of the psychological and sociological emphasis can also be integrated into a circumplex-focused approach, as demonstrated in Erfanian et al. (2021), where personal factors such as age, gender, and psychological well-being were analysed in terms of how they mediated the ISOPleasant and ISOEventful outcomes.\nThere has been some discussion regarding the interdependence of the PAs and the strict validity of the 90\\circ and 45\\circ relationships between the attributes (Lionello et al. 2021). Further work has indicated that the scaling between the attributes may vary, but the underlying relationships hold. It is for this reason that we have taken the coordinate projection as the starting point of this critique. It should also be noted that the particular PA descriptors used in ISO 12913 are intended for outdoor environments and should not be directly applied to indoor spaces. However, a proposed set of descriptors for some indoor environments has been derived which further confirms the validity of the circumplex relationships (Torresin et al. 2020). The methods proposed here should be directly applicable to indoor spaces by using the comfort/content descriptors as well as to any other translations of soundscape descriptors into other languages (Aletta et al. 2020) as long as the dimensional relationships of the circumplex are maintained."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve been on a bit of a classic science fiction trend for the last six months or so, only broken up by some classic Americana apocalyptica with It Can’t Happen Here by Sinclair Lewis (I’ll get to its write up at some point!). Foundation is actually the first Asimov book I remember reading, and it is fantastic (it should be, it won the Hugo award for Best All-time Series)!\n\nMade up of five interrelated short stories, Foundation tells the story of a man named Hari Seldon, who invented a new field of science call Psycho-history. The primary conceit of psycho-history is that, using mathematics, and the principles of statistical mechanics of large interacting systems, Seldon can predict the future of human societies. Inspired by concepts from physics, wherein the behaviour of individual particles cannot be predicted but by looking on a macro-enough scale, we can make probabilistic statements about the behaviour of large systems of particles, Asimov has applied these same principles to the prediction of human behaviour.\nRepeated over and over again is Seldon’s mantra that single humans both cannot be predicted and cannot change the course of the system, instead the human society, as a system, is driven by its complex internal interactions, toward a series of probabilities. By solving these equations and modelling these interactions, Seldon predicts that the galactic Empire in which he lives will soon collapse. Because of the principles of his psycho-history, he knows he can do nothing to stop this, but he can help to speed of the process of recovery. Without his intervention, he predicts it would take 30,000 for the Empire to recover from barbarism, but if he can find a way to preserve some of the existing scientific knowledge, this could be reduced to 1,000 years. To do this, he creates the eponymous Foundation based on two planets at opposite ends of the galaxy to create an Encyclopedia to preserve science. What follows are the stories of the Foundation following the collapse of the Empire and the inevitable successes of Seldon’s predictions and eventual mistakes.\n\nI think this story, and the concept of psychohistory particular intrigue me now because of the nature of my research. I and our research group are essentially trying to build statistical models of human perception. Like Seldon, we generally accept that it is impossible to predict the perception of a single person, but once a large enough scale is considered, statistical probabilities take over. Also like Seldon, we believe a key point to be that the subjects should not be aware of the study, lest they adjust their behaviour (although we haven’t solved this issue).\nAs we move further and further into the Algorithm age, with more complex system models which consider increasingly complex interacting factors, I think psychohistory will be on many researcher’s minds. Not as an aspiration, since I don’t think any serious scientist would buy that, but as potential source of learning. Science fiction has always allowed thinkers and scientists to view their work in new ways, and to consider the consequences of the advances they may make.\nI hope we can all be inspired and cautioned by great thinkers such as Isaac Asimov.\n\nI’ve also finished Foundation and Empire, the sequel, and I’m currently working my way through Prelude to Foundation, which I’m very excited about as it goes more in depth about the development of psychohistory.\nDuring my science fiction stint I also read the Dune series by Frank Herbert, so hopefully I’ll write that one up soon too.\nFor further ‘reading’ on the age of algorithms:\n\nSleepwalkers podcast\nHello World: How to Be Human in the Age of the Machine by Hannah Fry\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the UK, halfway through the PhD we undergo a process known as the ‘upgrade’. The purpose is to take stock of our progress made so far and to determine whether we are likely to make it to the end of the PhD successfully. To do this, we present a seminar and prepare a report of our current progress before having a session with an internal panel where they ask further questions about your work and the existing state of the field. If the panel confirms that we have made adequate progress and have a good plan to finish, we can be upgraded to a PhD candidate. I always find it really helpful to look at previous examples of stuff like this, and wasn’t able to find many examples or much guidance on what it should look like. To help others, I’ve decided to host my report here, feel free to use it as an example, but remember it meets the requirements of my specific department at this time, and yours may differ.\nOn a side note, because this year is wild, I received the email letting me know I passed my PhD upgrade while kneeling in the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Parliament Square. It can be difficult to process the emotions of outrage and frustration simultaneously with relief and hope. I don’t have anything more profound to say on that, except that shit’s crazy but life trudges on. I’ll be back out at the protests this weekend.\nIt also means I had to finally settle on a decent thesis title, I landed on Machine Learning and Regression Modelling of Dynamic Urban Soundscapes: A multilevel approach.\nDownload Report\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "title": "Book Diary 2 - Bad Science",
    "section": "",
    "text": "While I generally enjoyed the book, and I wholeheartedly support Goldacre’s goal and overall point, I was a bit disappointed by this book. I was initially inspired to pick it up by a friend recommending his book Bad Pharma.\nI had hoped that Bad Science would move away from his focus on medicine and turn instead to addressing mistakes and malpractice in science more generally. To my (only slight) disappointment, Goldacre hasn’t strayed far from his usual territory of medical frauds, mistakes, and hucksters.\nMy personal disappointment notwithstanding, this is in the end a well-written, well-researched, entertaining, and educational trawl through the depths of homeopaths and their overly diluted morals.\n\nAs always, I enjoy the insertion of personal details about the author, reminding me that there’s an actual person writing the words and that I’m allowed to both relate to and associate myself with the man behind the page, and to question and criticize him. Specific to this author was his mention of renting a small flat in Kentish Town on a junior medic’s salary – which I read while sat in a cafe next to my (smaller) flat in Kentish Town rented on a doctoral student’s stipend. While I suspect, with his multiple bestseller books, recognitions, and awards, Goldacre no longer rents a small flat in Kentish Town, it’d be nice to imagine having a friendly chat with him in the cafe.\nI felt the chapter ‘Pill Solves Complex Societal Problem’ was the most impactful. Here, Goldacre expands his discussion about the mechanics of poorly done science to address the media response to it and, more importantly, the potential motivations behind it. See this quote from page 154:\n\nBut above all we should pay tribute to the genius of this huge fish-oil project, and every other nutritionist who has gotten their pills into the media, and into schools, because more than anything else, they have sold children, at the most impressionable time of their lives, one very compelling message: that you need to take pills to lead a healthy normal life, and that a pill can even make up for failings elsewhere.\n\nWhat I can absolutely get behind is the view Goldacre reiterates over and over in the last few chapters: the blame for the dissemination of bad, misleading, or malicious science is not down to the bad actions of individual malevolent or ignorant scientists, but instead falls on the head of the system of media which not only allows this bad science to be spread, but encourages its spread. The individual scientists should absolutely be punished if wrong-doing is discovered, and bad practices should be stamped out, but the media system which publicises this work has a journalistic responsibility to look critically at everything it publishes. In general, it is more productive and more correct to lay the blame for societal issues at the feet of systems, not individuals.\n\nYou’ll notice, I hope, that I’m more interested in the cultural impact of nonsense – the medicalisation of everyday life, the undermining of sense – and in general I blame systems more than particular people. […] I do not blame individual journalists (for the most part) but I do blame whole systems of editors, and the people who buy newspapers with values to profess to despise.\n\n\nAs I’ve said, I thoroughly enjoyed Bad Science and I applaud Goldacre’s writing and his ability to distill the important aspects of scientific research into a wide-ranging and engaging discussion, but I hope he someday chooses to move beyond medicine and discuss ‘science’ more fully. As he notes in his afterword,\n\n…in the 1950s science reporting was about engineering and inventions, but by the 1990s everything had changed. Science coverage now tends to come from the world of medicine, and the stories are of what will kill you, or save you.\n\nPeople have forgotten that science can be about more than medicine and about more than our constant human obsession with death and illness, and I’d like to see more authors remind us of that.\nFurther reading: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_with_fraudulent_diplomas\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"
