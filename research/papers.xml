<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>As the future of urban sound research and practice moves toward a more holistic soundscape focus, the ability to affect change at large scales and in a wide range of projects will require that familiar engineering tools and approaches can be applied to soundscape design. When attempting to apply soundscape in practice in the built environment, it becomes apparent that a predictive model of the users’ perceptual response to the acoustic environment is necessary. Whether to determine the impact of a design change, or to integrate a large scale data at neighbourhood and city levels, a mathematical model of the interacting factors will form a vital component of the implementation of the soundscape approach.</p>
<p>Current methods of assessing soundscapes are generally limited to a post hoc assessment of the existing environment, where users of the space in question are surveyed regarding their experience of the acoustic environment <span class="citation" data-cites="Engel2018Review Zhang2018Effect Ba2019Effect">(Engel et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018; Ba and Kang 2019)</span>. While this approach has proved useful in identifying the impacts of an existing environment, designers require the ability to predict how a change or proposed design will impact the soundscape of the space, before its implementation. To this end, a model that is built on measurable or estimate-able quantities of the environment would represent a leap forward in the ability to design soundscapes and to assess their broad impacts on health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>We will begin by outlining the use cases of predictive soundscape models and how they are necessary for certain applications. From the desired use cases, we will then outline a framework within which practical predictive models can be developed.</p>

<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2016Soundscape">Aletta, Kang, and Axelsson (2016)</span> provide a review of the soundscape descriptors and indicators commonly used in soundscape research and outlines an initial framework for developing predictive soundscape models. In their review, the authors identified eight potential soundscape descriptors, including perceived affective quality <span class="citation" data-cites="Axelsson2010principal">(Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2010)</span>, restorativeness <span class="citation" data-cites="Payne2013production">(Payne 2013)</span>, etc. Similarly, the authors identified a range of potential indicators used to characterise the acoustic environment, including environmental acoustics indicators such as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BCeq%7D%20%E2%88%92%20L_%7BAeq%7D"> and psychoacoustic indicators such as Loudness (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_5">) and Sharpness (S).</p>
<p>However, it is noted that several studies show that no single psychoacoustic indicator alone can explain the variation in soundscape responses (as expressed via the descriptors) (e.g. <span class="citation" data-cites="PerssonWaye2002Psycho">(Persson Waye and Öhrström 2002)</span>). The goal of statistical modelling, therefore is to create a more complex and complete representation of the relationship between soundscape indicators and descriptors, beyond what any single indicator could achieve.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;1 shows a conceptual view of this relationship. We start with <strong>soundscape indicators</strong>, which characterise the physical and contextual environment to which the listener is exposed. This can be broken down into <strong>sonic features</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;the acoustical features listed above) and <strong>characteristics of the space itself</strong> (e.g.&nbsp;the amount of visible sky, the intended use-case of the space, how crowded the space is, etc.). In order to translate from the physical inputs to an expressed description of the soundscape perception, we introduce the concept of a <strong>perceptual mapping</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="Lionello2021new">(Lionello 2021)</span>. This mapping represents a simplified idea of how each individual’s brain processes the inputs from the soundscape which they experience, forms a perception, and finally expresses that perception through their description of the soundscape. For our purposes, this perceptual mapping is treated as essentially a black box mapping inputs to outputs. It can be conceived of as a network of weights in which certain characteristics of the sound may have different weights and directions depending on the context, through which all of the inputs are processed, resulting in the soundscape rating. Conceptually, this perceptual mapping – the pathways and weightings through which the inputs are processed before being expressed as a perceptual descriptor – is established prior to an individual’s exposure to the soundscape in question.</p>

<p>It should be made clear that this represents a very simplified view of how a soundscape perception is formed, however it provides a useful conceptual framework for the purposes of understanding and modelling how someone’s perception forms in response to their exposure to a space. One way to consider the function of a statistical model of soundscape perception is as replicating the perceptual mapping between soundscape indicators and descriptors <span class="citation" data-cites="Lionello2021new">(Lionello 2021)</span>. As a person experiences an urban space, they are exposed to an array of physical inputs, these are then processed by the listener through their own personal experience and mapped to their perception of that space. This perception is then expressed through their description of this experience of the soundscape. It is this mapping of physical inputs to perceptual description which the statistical model aims to reflect. The most successful model would then accurately replicate the general perceptual mapping across the population.</p>

<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="applications-in-design-and-mapping"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Applications in design and mapping</h2>
<p>The soundscape approach faces several challenges in practical applications which are unaddressed by current assessment methods, but which may be solved through the development of a predictive modelling framework. The first of these challenges is predicting how a change in an existing sound environment will be reflected in the soundscape perception. While it is possible in this scenario to measure the existing soundscape perception via questionnaire surveys, if a change is then introduced to the acoustic environment, it is so far impossible to say what the resulting soundscape change would be. This question relates strongly to the idea of soundscape interventions; where a particular noise pollution challenge is addressed by introducing more pleasant sounds (e.g.&nbsp;a water feature), following the soundscape principle of treating sound as a resource <span class="citation" data-cites="Lavia2016Soundscape Moshona2022What">(Lavia et al. 2016; Moshona et al. 2022)</span>. Predicting how much a particular intervention would improve the soundscape (or, indeed whether it would improve at all) is not yet possible with the retrospective methods available.</p>
<p>Several studies have attempted to address this gap by developing machine learning or statistical models of soundscape perception which are focussed on prediction, rather than inference. An array of modelling techniques are used, with linear regression being the most common <span class="citation" data-cites="Lionello2020systematic">(Lionello, Aletta, and Kang 2020)</span>, and also including artificial neural networks (ANN) <span class="citation" data-cites="PuyanaRomero2016Modelling Yu2009Modeling">(Puyana Romero et al. 2016; Yu and Kang 2009)</span> and support vector regression (SVR) <span class="citation" data-cites="Fan2016Automatic Fan2017Emo Giannakopoulos2019Athens">(Fan, Thorogood, and Pasquier 2016, 2017; Giannakopoulos, Orfanidi, and Perantonis 2019)</span>. However, these studies have focussed primarily on using these models to investigate the constructs of soundscape perception, with few efforts to put the models themselves to use. <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021Investigating">Mitchell et al. (2021)</span> attempted to address this by both developing a predictive model and applying it to an applied scenario where traditional assessment methods were impractical. In a unique application, <span class="citation" data-cites="Ooi2022Probably">Ooi et al. (2022)</span> created a predictive model of soundscape pleasantness which fed an automated and reactive soundscape enhancement system <span class="citation" data-cites="Watcharasupat2022Autonomous">(Watcharasupat et al. 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>Retrospective methods also struggle to capture the dynamics of the soundscape in a space. Whether through the narrative interview method of ISO/TS 12913-2 <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part2">(ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 2018)</span>, through soundwalks, or through in situ questionnaires <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2020Soundscape">(Mitchell et al. 2020)</span>, only the soundscape during the particular period which the researchers are actively investigating is captured. This makes it very difficult to determine diurnal, seasonal, or yearly patterns of the soundscape. These patterns may be driven by corresponding diurnal, seasonal, or yearly patterns in the acoustic or visual environment, or by variations in how people process and respond to the sound at different times of day/season/year. Currently the only way to investigate any of these patterns is through repeated surveys. Predictive modelling, on the other hand, could allow a trained soundscape model to be paired with longterm monitoring methods to track how a soundscape perception may change in response to changes in the acoustic environment.</p>
<p>Similarly, a move towards modelling methods based on objective and/or measurable factors would facilitate the application of mapping in soundscape. While noise maps have become common in urban noise research and legislation <span class="citation" data-cites="EEA2020Environmental Gasco2020Social">(EEA 2020; Gasco et al. 2020)</span>, they can be difficult to translate into a soundscape approach. The Environmental Noise Directive (END) <span class="citation" data-cites="EuropeanUnion2002Directive">(European Union 2002)</span>, first implemented in 2002, is the main EU instrument to identify noise pollution impacts and track urban noise levels across the EU. Its goals were to determine the population’s exposure to environmental noise, make information on environmental noise available to the public, and prevent and reduce environmental noise and its effects. In general, noise maps are based on modelled traffic flows, from which decibel levels are extrapolated and mapped, although interpolation and mobile measurement methods have also been recently developed <span class="citation" data-cites="Aumond2018Probabilistic">(see Aumond, Jacquesson, and Can 2018)</span>. Alternatively, they can be produced using longterm SLMs or sensor networks. While these methods have significant utility for tracking increases in urban noise levels and are important for determining the health and societal impacts of noise on a large scale, their restricted focus on noise levels alone limits their scope and reduces the potential for identifying more nuanced health and psychological effects of urban sound.</p>
<p>Several studies have attempted to bring soundscape to urban noise mapping. The most notable of these attempts <span class="citation" data-cites="Aumond2018Probabilistic Aletta2015Soundscape Hong2017Exploring Kang2018Impact">(Aumond, Jacquesson, and Can 2018; Aletta and Kang 2015; Hong and Jeon 2017; Kang and Aletta 2018)</span> bring new, more sophisticated methods for mapping urban sound (not just noise levels). For instance, all four present methods which map the relative level of various sound sources, producing maps of the spatial distribution of bird sounds, human voices, water sounds, etc. In <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2015Soundscape">Aletta and Kang (2015)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Hong2017Exploring">Hong and Jeon (2017)</span> the mapping relied on soundscape surveys conducted in public spaces, then used interpolation methods and basic relationships to the measured noise levels to generate a map of the perceived soundscape over the entire study space. <span class="citation" data-cites="Kang2018model">Kang et al. (2018)</span>, after starting with survey responses, attempted to create a prediction methods which relied only on the audio recordings made in the space to create visual maps of the predicted soundscape perception (i.e.&nbsp;the perceptual attributes ’pleasant’, ’calm’, ’eventful’, ’annoying’, ’chaotic’, ’monotonous’). According to the authors, the prediction and mapping model would follow three steps: (1) sound sources recognition and profiling, (2) prediction of the soundscape’s perceptual attributes, and (3) implementation of soundscape maps. Unfortunately, from the paper, it appears that the prediction model results were not actually used for the mapping and, again, the survey responses from 21 respondents were interpolated to create the soundscape map. Their results indicated how a predictive model could have been slotted into a mapping use-case, but this was limited by (1) the relatively poor predictive performance for several of the attributes, (2) the inability to automatically recognise sound sources, and (3) a very limited dataset in terms of sample size and variety of locations.</p>
<p>While the connection is not made to perception, <span class="citation" data-cites="Aumond2018Probabilistic">Aumond, Jacquesson, and Can (2018)</span> focussed on creating sound maps which can reflect the pattern of sound source emergences over time within a city. By stochastically activating varying sound sources across their map, they could map the percentage of time when a sound source emerges from the overall complex sound environment. If a predictive soundscape model which incorporates sound source information can be developed, then the same procedure which led to their sound source emergence maps could also feed the soundscape model, resulting in a map of predicted perception over time.</p>
<p>Urban scale noise mapping and its implementation at the international level has been crucial in highlighting the health impacts of urban noise and in providing evidence for the negative cost of excess noise. Traffic flow models of noise, large community noise surveys, and policy requirements to track noise levels have all been necessary to reveal these impacts. By creating predictive soundscape models, combined with new tools and sensing capabilities from smart city efforts, we can bring soundscape into these same realms. Without this, these large-scale impact studies will be limited to valuing the negative cost of urban noise, missing the potential value of positive soundscapes. By bringing perception-based practice to the same scale and type of evidence, we can expand urban sound research to consider a holistic view of urban spaces and their impacts.</p>
<p>The broader use-case and need for such soundscape models and maps was recently highlighted by <span class="citation" data-cites="Jiang2022Ten">Jiang et al. (2022)</span>, which opens the discussion for how the value and impact of soundscapes should be measured and what tools are needed to enable the valuation of policy interventions for soundscapes. In response to Question 5, “What soundscape metrics and data will be needed?”, the authors make clear the necessity of predictive soundscape models: “Quantitative soundscape metrics that link subjective perceptions to objective acoustic and contextual factors will be needed, to enable monetisation while at the same time account for the perception-based nature of soundscape.” In addition, the authors make a strong case for the need for soundscape indices: “Despite the varied requirements for soundscape metrics and data between and even within valuation methods, a standardised metric or set of metrics, such as dB in noise valuation [. . . ] will allow comparison and integration of different studies and building compatible evidence bases.”</p>

<h2 data-number="4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-predictive-soundscape-model-framework"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> The Predictive Soundscape Model Framework</h2>
<p>Several forms and iterations of predictive models have been developed <span class="citation" data-cites="Lionello2020systematic">(Lionello, Aletta, and Kang 2020)</span> and more recently they have been put to use in real-world use cases <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021Investigating Watcharasupat2022Autonomous">(Mitchell et al. 2021; Watcharasupat et al. 2022)</span>. To improve on these models and make them into a useful engineering tool, we should establish a framework of overarching goals for models to achieve and the resulting development constraints. In general, the goals we define are related to how we might wish for models to be used and deployed, while the constraints are practical limitations which may make the performance of a given model less than ideal, but are necessary to achieve the deployment goals.</p>
<section id="goals" class="level3" data-number="4.1">
<h3 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="goals"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Goals</h3>
<p>Before defining what form a general practical predictive model should take, we first need to make clear what the goals of such a model are, as derived from the preceding discussion laying out why predictive models are needed in soundscape.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy</strong> – First, that it to a reasonable extent is successful in predicting the collective perception <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2022How">(see Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang 2022)</span> of a soundscape. It should succeed at both indicating the central tendency of the soundscape perception, but importantly it should also inform the likely spread of perception among the population. The outcome of the predictive model should not be focussed on predicting an individual assessment; the goal is not the predict the perception of any specific individual, but to reflect the public’s perception of a public space. In other words, ideally the model will result in an accurate distribution of soundscape perceptions for the target population.</p>
<p><strong>Automation</strong> – Second, that it can be implemented automatically. Once an initial setup is performed, such as identifying what location the measurements are conducted in, the model should be capable of moving from recorded information to predicted soundscape distribution without human intervention. We need soundscape assessments to be able to be performed instrumentally. This enables it to be applied to unmanned uses, such as smart city sensors and soundscape mapping. It is impractical to conduct soundscape surveys or soundwalks in every location we wish to map and certainly not when we wish to see how these locations change over longer periods of time. A predictive model should allow us to survey these soundscapes remotely in order to extend soundscape to city-scale assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Comparisons</strong> – Third, the model should enable us to test, score, and compare proposed interventions. In a design context, it is crucial that various strategies and interventions can be tested and that the influencing factors can be identified. The model should assist the user in highlighting what factor is limiting the success of a soundscape, spark ideas for how to address it, and allow these ideas to be tested. Several other useful features of predictive soundscape models arise out of these goals and will be discussed later, but these form the core goals of the framework.</p>
</section>
<section id="constraints" class="level3" data-number="4.2">
<h3 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="constraints"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Constraints</h3>
<p>If we accept that predictive models are necessary to advance a more holistic approach to urban sound in smart cities, we must then define the constraints of such a model. The goal here is to define a framework for what is needed from a future model intended to be used in a smart city sensors, soundscape mapping, or urban design context.</p>
<p><strong>Inputs</strong> – The first constraint is that the model must be based on measurable factors. By this, we mean that the data which eventually feeds into the predictive model should be collected via sensor measurements of one sort or another; this could be acoustic sound level measurements or recordings, environmental measurements, video recordings, or GIS measurements, etc. What it certainly cannot include is perceptual data. This is strictly a practical constraint – for a predictive model designed to be used in practice, there is no justification to include other perceptual factors, such as perceived greenness, derived from surveys but not whichever factor you desire to predict. If the goal is to predict soundscape pleasantness and it is necessary to survey people about the visual pleasantness, why not just also survey them about the soundscape pleasantness directly? Certainly this mix of perceptual data is useful in research and can elucidate the relationship between the sonic and visual environments, but it is not useful in a practical predictive context. Any results which arise from research combining this sort of perceptual information must eventually be translated into a component which can itself be measured or modelled.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong> – The second constraint is that any analysis of the measured data can be done automatically, without human intervention. If the eventual goal is to deploy the model on continuously-running, unmanned sensor nodes or to enable practical large-scale measurements, the predictive model should be capable of operating with minimal human input. This means, for instance that if the model includes information about the sound source, this identification of the source should be possible to do automatically (i.e.&nbsp;through environmental sound recognition).</p>
<p>A potential constraint for some applications is related to computation time. Since one proposed application of a predictive soundscape model is to embed the model on a WASN node, the model would then need to be able to run on relatively low-power hardware such as a Raspberry Pi with a reasonable latency. This would especially present an issue for those models which rely on the combination of several psychoacoustic features <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021Investigating Orga2021Multilevel">(such as Mitchell et al. 2021; Orga et al. 2021)</span>, since these features are computationally intensive to calculate and several of them may need to be computed for each time step of the model. Although this is a real practical concern that should be addressed in the future, for the sake of this initial definition of a general predictive model used across many applications, we have not considered this a strict constraint.</p>
<p><strong>Generalisability</strong> – The third constraint is for the model to be generalisable to new locations. Ideally, it will be generalisable to new and (to it) unfamiliar soundscape types, but the minimum requirement should be that it can be applied to new locations which are otherwise similar to those in the training data. This means that any factors which are used to characterise the context provided by the location should be distinguished from a simple label of the location and should instead be derived from measurements of the location. In practice this could be geographical or architectural characteristics of the space, a proposed use-case of the space, or consistent visual characteristics of the space such as the proportion of pavement to green elements. This is in contrast to the model created in <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021Investigating">Mitchell et al. (2021)</span> which was constrained to be used only on those locations included in the training data since it made use of a location label.</p>
<p>For this third point, some aspects of the first and second constraints can be relaxed. Since this would only need to be defined once for a location, definitions such as the use case of the space could be defined by the person using the model. What is necessary is that the model and its component location-context factors can be set up ahead of time by the user, then the recording-level effects are able to be calculated automatically. In a multi-level modelling (MLM) context (such as that used in <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021Investigating">(Mitchell et al. 2021)</span>, this essentially amounts to choosing the appropriate location-level coefficients ahead of time then automatically calculating the features which are fed into those coefficients (per constraint 1 &amp; 2).</p>
<p><strong>Robustness</strong> – Finally, the model should be robust to missing components. If the original or full construction of the model depends on demographic information of the population using the space, in cases where this information is not available, it should be possible to omit it and still obtain a reasonable result. Here we may define potential ‘must-have’ and ‘optional’ factors. Given the amount of variance explained by the various factors which have been considered in previous predictive models, in-depth acoustic information is a must-have, while demographic and personal factors are an optional factor where the trade-off of losing 3% of the explained variance in eventfulness <span class="citation" data-cites="Erfanian2021Psychological">(Erfanian et al. 2021)</span> is accepted as reasonable. Based on the results of <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021Investigating">Mitchell et al. (2021)</span>, it would appear that location-context is crucial for modelling the pleasantness, but not for modelling the eventfulness. In order to determine the must-have factors for characterising the location-context, more work will need to be done to determine the appropriate input factors and their relative importance.</p>

<p>There are various potential methods for integrating the predictive soundscape approach into a design and intervention setting. Not all spaces can or should have the same soundscape and soundscapes should be treated as dynamic, not static; identifying and creating an appropriate soundscape for the particular use case of a space is crucial to guiding its design. Proper forwardlooking design of a soundscape would involve defining the desired collective perception in the space. In the probabilistic soundscape approach from <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2022How">Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang (2022)</span>, this can be achieved by drawing the desired shape in the circumplex and testing interventions which will bring the existing soundscape closer to the desired perception. A soundscape may need to be perceived as vibrant during the day and calm for some portion of the evening, meaning the desired shape should primarily sit within the vibrant quadrant but have some overlap into calm. This also enables designers to recognise the limitations of their environment and acknowledge that it is not always possible to transform a highly chaotic soundscape into a calm one. In these cases, instead the focus should be placed on shifting the perception to some degree in a positive direction.</p>

<p>The most sophisticated method of setting design goals is therefore to identify the desired shape which represents the variety of desired outcomes, and focus on designs and interventions which are most successful in matching the predicted outcome with that goal. This strategy of defining the optimal soundscape as an area or a shape within the 2-dimensional circumplex was previously illustrated by <span class="citation" data-cites="Cain2013development">Cain, Jennings, and Poxon (2013)</span>. In Figure&nbsp;2, we have adapted Cain’s Figure 6 to show how the shape of a target soundscape can be set and the shape of the existing soundscape compared to it. The work of a designer is then trialling intervention options which move the design soundscape closer to the target soundscape.</p>

<h2 data-number="6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="towards-soundscape-indices"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Towards Soundscape Indices</h2>
<p>Although the types of visualisations developed in <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2022How">(Mitchell, Aletta, and Kang 2022)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Cain2013development">(Cain, Jennings, and Poxon 2013)</span> are a powerful tool for viewing, analysing, and discussing the multi-dimensional aspects of soundscape perception, there are certainly cases where simpler metrics are needed to aid discussion and to set design goals. Within the practicalities of built environment projects, the consequences and successes of a design often need to be quantifiable within a single index. Whether to demonstrate performance indicators to a client or to set and meet consistent policy requirements, numerical ratings and/or rankings are necessary. This therefore necessitates the creation of consistent and validated indices which indicate the degree to which a proposal achieves a set design goal.</p>
<p>The challenge for creating a single number index lies in properly combining the two-plus dimensions of soundscape perception with the needs of a specific project into a single index. The obvious option would be to ignore the multi-dimensionality and only score soundscape designs on the basis of their pleasantness score (as done in <span class="citation" data-cites="Ooi2022Probably">(Ooi et al. 2022)</span>). However, this seems to ignore both the significant importance of the eventfulness dimension in shaping the character of a soundscape and the role of appropriateness in determining the ’optimal soundscape’ for a space. Ideally, a soundscape index (or set of soundscape indices) would succeed at capturing all these aspects into a single scoring metric.</p>

<h2 data-number="7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The existing methods for soundscape assessment and measurement, such as those given in the ISO 12913 series, have been focussed primarily on determining the status quo of an environment. That is, they are able to determine how the space is currently perceived, but offer little insight into hypothetical environments. As such, they are less relevant for design purposes, where a key goal is to determine how a space will be perceived, not just how an existing space is perceived. The methods for assessment outlined in <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part2">ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018)</span> and for analysis given in <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part3">ISO/TS 12913-3:2019 (2019)</span> are inherently limited to post hoc assessments of an existing space. Since they are focussed on surveying people on their experience of the environment, it stands that the space must already exist for people to be able to experience. Toward this, and following from the combination of perceptual and objective data collection encouraged in <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part2">ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018)</span>, the natural push from the design perspective is towards ’predictive modelling’.</p>

  abstract = {With the recent standardization of soundscape, there has
    been increased interest in bringing the soundscape approach into an
    engineering context. While traditional assessment methods, such as
    those given in the ISO 12913 series, provide information on the
    current status quo of an environment, they offer limited insight
    into hypothetical environments and are therefore less relevant for
    design purposes. This conference paper presents a conceptual
    framework for the practical use of predictive soundscape models and
    indices. The framework outlines the goals, constraints, and
    potential applications of these models and highlights the need for
    further research in this area to better understand the dynamics of
    soundscape perception and to put predictive models to practical use.
    Predictive soundscape models can be integrated with soundscape
    indices - such as those being developed by the Soundscape Indices
    (SSID) project - for assessment purposes, providing a comprehensive
    approach to evaluating and designing sound environments. The use of
    predictive models is necessary to address the challenges faced in
    practical applications of the soundscape approach and to fill the
    gap between traditional assessment methods and the design of sound
    environments.}

<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Methods for collecting data on how people experience acoustic environments have been at the forefront of the debate in soundscape studies for the past 20 years. While the soundscape research field as we understand it today dates back to the late 1960s with the pioneering work of authors like M. Southworth <span class="citation" data-cites="Southworth1969sonic">(Southworth 1969)</span>, R.M. Schafer <span class="citation" data-cites="SoundscapeOursonicSchafer">(Schafer 1977)</span>, and H. Westerkamp <span class="citation" data-cites="westerkamp2002linking">(Westerkamp 2002)</span>, the theme of data collection methods for soundscape assessment emerged more prominently only recently <span class="citation" data-cites="kang2016ten">(Kang et al. 2016)</span>. There is a general consensus in the research community that standardised tools to gather and report individual responses on the perception of urban acoustic environments are indeed desirable, to provide comparable datasets and soundscape characterisations across different locations, times, and samples of people, as well as allowing for replicability studies, and offering inputs for modelling algorithms in soundscape prediction and design tasks. These were among the main drivers for the establishment of a Working Group at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) back in 2008, which was named “Perceptual assessment of soundscape quality” (ISO/TC 43/SC 1/WG 54) that has so far published three documents within the ISO 12913 series on soundscape. Part 1 (ISO 12913-1:2014) is a full standard and provides a general framework and definitions of soundscape concepts <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913_1">(ISO 2014)</span>, while Part 2 (ISO/TS 12913-2:2018) and Part 3 (ISO/TS 12913-3:2019) are technical specifications and offer guidance on how data should be collected and analysed, accordingly <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913_2 ISO12913_3">(ISO 2018, 2019)</span> (Part 4, on soundscape design interventions, is currently under development by the working group, also registered as a technical specifications document). Specifically, Part 3 presents the proposed methods for analysing and representing the data collected by the soundscape surveys. Since the development of these standards, the focus has shifted from understanding individual perception to characterising the collective perception of increasingly large groups.</p>
<p>In a recent editorial paper on Soundscape Assessment, Axelsson and colleagues observe that it is important to critically discuss current theories and models in soundscape studies and to examine their effectiveness, while also looking at how to integrate different methods and perspectives for the discipline to make further advancements <span class="citation" data-cites="Axelsson2019editorial">(Axelsson, Guastavino, and Payne 2019)</span>. This work was mainly aimed at addressing the issue of meaningful comparability and representation of soundscape assessments. Part 2 of the ISO 12913 standard itself does not provide ultimate answers: the technical specifications recommend multiple methods, as consensus around a single protocol could not be reached. This diversity of methodological approaches should be interpreted as a fact that soundscape theory is still under development and, for this reason, the standardisation work should probably take a step back and focus on developing a reference method for comparability among soundscape studies, rather than a single protocol for soundscape data collection. Some attempts have indeed already been made in literature for the different methods proposed in the ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 <span class="citation" data-cites="aletta2019exploring">Jo, Seo, and Jeon (2020)</span>. Neither the standard nor the general soundscape literature has settled on effective methods of analysing and representing the data that results from these protocols. Data visualisations are particularly important for understanding and communicating information as multifaceted as soundscape perception <span class="citation" data-cites="tufte2001visual">(Tufte 2001)</span>. Although it is unlikely that any single method will be sufficient, attempts should be made to both facilitate future advancements in this realm and to develop a first step approach that captures the inherent uncertainty in perception studies, since including uncertainty is considered one of the core principles of good data visualisation <span class="citation" data-cites="Midway2020Principles">(Midway 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>This study thus aims to review the consequences of these methods for larger datasets and provide concrete examples for how soundscapes should be represented. In particular, we aim to strengthen the practices for characterising the soundscape of a location, as a collective perception by the users of the location. We also demonstrate how the progress of these tools from their initial scope (measuring and discussing the individual perception of a soundwalk participant) have not kept up with recent advances and requirements for larger-scale soundscape datasets. We question whether there are some issues related to the data collection instruments and data analysis methods as recommended and examine the results of the model framework and mathematical transformations laid out in the ISO technical specifications to guide the interpretation of the soundscape circumplex.</p>
<p>To examine these tools and the questions raised, we apply them to an existing large scale, real-world dataset of soundscape assessments collected according to the ISO methods. Finally, we propose a more holistic and advanced method of representing soundscapes as a probabilistic distribution of perceptions within the circumplex and provide a toolbox for others to use.</p>

<p>Although different methods are proposed for data collection in ISO12913 Part 2 <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913_2">(ISO 2018)</span>, in the context of this study we focus on the questionnaire-based soundscape assessment (Method A), because it is underpinned by a theoretical relationship among the items of the questionnaire that compose it. The core of this questionnaire is the 8 perceptual attributes (PA) originally derived in <span class="citation" data-cites="Axelsson2010Principal">Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund (2010)</span>: pleasant, vibrant (or exciting), eventful, chaotic, annoying, monotonous, uneventful, and calm. In the questionnaire procedure, these PAs are assessed independently of each other, however they are conceptually considered to form a two-dimensional circumplex with <em>{Pleasantness} and </em>Eventfulness* on the x- and y-axis, respectively, where all regions of the space are equally likely to accommodate a given soundscape assessment <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2016Soundscape">(Aletta, Kang, and Axelsson 2016)</span>. In <span class="citation" data-cites="Axelsson2010Principal">Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund (2010)</span>, a third primary dimension, <em>Familiarity</em> was also found, however this only accounted for 8% of the variance and is typically disregarded as part of the standard circumplex. As will be made clear throughout, the circumplex model has several aspects which make it useful for representing the soundscape perception of a space as a whole.</p>

<p>To facilitate the analysis of the PA responses, the Likert scale responses are coded from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree) as ordinal variables. In order to reduce the 8 PA values into a pair of coordinates which can be plotted on the Pleasant-Eventful axes, Part 3 of ISO 12913 <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913_3">(ISO 2019)</span> provides a trigonometric transformation, based on the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?45%5Ccirc">-relationship between the diagonal axes and the pleasant and eventful axes. This transformation projects the coded values from the individual PAs down onto the primary Pleasantness and Eventfulness dimensions then adds them together to form a single coordinate pair. In theory, this coordinate pair then encapsulates information from all 8 PA dimensions onto a more easily understandable and analysable two dimensions. The ISO coordinates are thus calculated by:</p>
<p><span id="eq-pleasant"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbegin%7Bsplit%7D%0A%20%20%20%20ISO%20Pleasant%20=%20%5B(pleasant%20-%20annoying)%20+%20%5Ccos%2045%5Ccirc%20*%20(calm%20-%20chaotic)%20%5C%5C%20+%20%5Ccos%2045%5Ccirc%20*%20(vibrant%20-%20monotonous)%5D%20*%201/(4+%5Csqrt%7B32)%7D%0A%5Cend%7Bsplit%7D%0A%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>

<p>where the PAs are arranged around the circumplex as shown in Figure&nbsp;1. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ccos%2045%5Ccirc"> term operates to project the diagonal terms down onto the x and y axes, and the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%20/%20(4%20+%20%5Csqrt%7B32%7D)"> scales the resulting coordinates to the range (-1, 1). The result of this transformation is demonstrated in Figure&nbsp;1. This treatment of the 8 PAs makes several assumptions and inferences about the relationships between the dimensions.

<p>While the assessment methods available are able to record the soundscape perception of a single individual, and that person’s perception is valid for themselves, it is not appropriate to then state that it is representative of the collective perception of that soundscape. In order to characterise the soundscape of a particular space or time, perceptual responses from multiple people must be collected and subsequently summarised or aggregated to describe the general soundscape of the location. The ISO guidelines stipulate a minimum of 20 participants for a soundwalk, with these broken up into sessions of no more than 5 participants at a time. Part 3 then provides the recommended methods for analysing this data.</p>
<p>Annex A.2 of ISO 12913 Part 3 provides the statistical measures to be used on the raw PA responses. The recommended measure of central tendency is the median, while the recommended measure of dispersion is the range. These are chosen as the data is ordinal by nature, however as will be demonstrated later, they have significant limitations. Although it is unclear, the implied intention is then that the median value of each PA is fed into Equation&nbsp;1 and Equation&nbsp;2 presented above to calculate the ISOPleasant and ISOEventful values, which can then be plotted in a two-dimensional scatter plot. Thus the standard suggests that 1) the projection method equations are not applied to individual responses and 2) only the median assessment of a location should be plotted.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-of-the-iso"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Limitations of the ISO</h2>
<p>How these methods should be applied to represent the soundscape of a location has not been adequately discussed in previous literature, nor sufficiently in Part 3 of ISO 1293 itself. Indeed, in Section A.3, the technical specifications document state that <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913_3">(ISO 2019, 5)</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Results can be reported in a two-dimensional scatter plot with coordinates for the two dimensions ‘pleasantness’ and ‘eventfulness’. The coordinates for ‘pleasantness’ are plotted on the X-axis, and the coordinates for ‘eventfulness’ on the Y-axis. Every data point in the scatter plot represents one investigated site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, it is not made clear whether this single point on the circumplex can be considered to be a realistic representation of the average perception of the acoustic environment. Effectively, there is no representation of dispersion in the soundscape assessment, nor a recommended use of the range that was calculated as part of the analysis recommend in Section A.2 of Part 3 of the ISO 12913. Absent a suggestion from the ISO 12913 for how the range should be used, we therefore apply this analysis to an existing real-world soundscape dataset to determine whether it provides a useful measure of dispersion. Here we use the data contained in the International Soundscape Database (ISD) <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021International">(Mitchell, Oberman, Aletta, Erfanian, et al. 2021)</span>, which includes 1,300+ individual responses collected across 13 locations in London and Venice, according to the SSID Protocol, which is based on the ISO methods explored in this paper <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2020Protocol">(Mitchell et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>For any large enough sample for a site, the range will always be from 1 to 5, the maximum and minimum available Likert-scale values. We would expect that collecting more data would result in more information or better precision, however the range will always increase as the sample size increases. As an example, within the ISD data, of the 8 PAs collected at 13 locations (for a total of 104 scales), 88% have a range from 1 to 5 and with larger sample sizes at each location, this percentage would only have increased. Using range to analyse the dispersion provides very limited information for comparing the soundscape assessments of different locations, or of a location under different conditions.</p>
<p>Although the range does not appear to be a useful measure of dispersion, the median does provide a useful measure and appropriately functions to describe the central tendency of the soundscape assessment of the sample. However, by stipulating that the median of each PA should be taken prior to applying the circumplex projection, the ISO procedure only allows for plotting a single scatter point in the circumplex for each location and does not allow for plotting individual responses on the circumplex. This limits the possibilities for visualising the general trends in individual perception across the soundscape. Finally, no example or recommendation for how the circumplex scatter plot should be presented is given in the standard.</p>
<p>The instruments described in the ISO 12913 Part 2 <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913_2">(ISO 2018)</span> were originally designed primarily for the context of individual or small group assessments. In these scenarios, the focus is on assessing the particular soundscape perception of the person in question. Recent advances in the soundscape approach since the development of the standards have shifted some focus from individual soundscapes to characterising the overall soundscape of public spaces <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2020Protocol">(Mitchell et al. 2020)</span> and to making comparisons between different groups of people <span class="citation" data-cites="Jeon2018cross">(Jeon et al. 2018)</span>. In this context, a consideration of the natural variation in people’s perception and the variation over time of a soundscape must be a core feature of how the soundscape is discussed. Reducing a public space which may have between tens and tens of thousands of people moving through it in a single day down to the mean (or median, or any other single metric) soundscape assessment often dismisses the reality of the space. Likewise, this overall soundscape of a public space cannot be determined through a ten person soundwalk, as there is no guarantee that the sample of people engaged in the soundwalk is representative of the users of the space (in fact it is likely they would not be).</p>

<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> The Way Forward: Pleasant-Eventful Coordinates and Probabilistic Soundscape Representation</h1>
<p>Given the identified issues with the recommended methods for statistical analysis and their shortcomings in representing the variation in perception of the soundscape in a space, how then should we discuss or present the results of these soundscape assessments? Ideally, the method will: 1) take advantage of the circumplex coordinates and their ability to be displayed on a scatter plot and treated as continuous variables, 2) scale from a dataset of twenty responses to thousands of responses, 3) facilitate the comparison of the soundscapes of different locations, conditions, and groups, and 4) encapsulate the nuances and diversity of soundscape perception by representing the distribution of responses.</p>
<p>We therefore present a visualisation in Figure&nbsp;2 of the soundscape assessments of several urban spaces included in the ISD <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021International">(Mitchell, Oberman, Aletta, Erfanian, et al. 2021)</span> which reflects these goals. The specific locations selected from the ISD are chosen for demonstration only and these methods can be applied to any location. Rather than attempting to represent a single individual’s soundscape or of describing a location’s soundscape as a single average assessment (as in <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021Investigating">Mitchell, Oberman, Aletta, Kachlicka, et al. (2021)</span>), this representation shows the whole range of perception of the users of the space. First, rather than calculating the median response to each PA in the location, then calculating the circumplex coordinates, the coordinates for each individual response are calculated. This results in a vector of ISOPleasant, ISOEventful values which are continuous variables from -1 to +1 and can be analysed statistically by calculating summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, quantiles, etc.) and through the use of regression modelling, which can often be simpler and more familiar than the recommended methods of analysing ordinal data. This also enables each individual’s response to be placed within the pleasant-eventful space. All of the responses for a location can then be plotted, giving an overall scatter plot for a location, as demonstrated in Figure&nbsp;2 (a).</p>

<p>Once these individual responses are plotted, we then overlay a heatmap of the bivariate distribution (with isodensity curves for each decile) and marginal distribution plots<sup>1</sup>. In this way, three primary characteristics of the soundscape perception can be seen:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The distribution across both pleasantness and eventfulness, including the central tendency, the dispersion, and any skewness in the response;</p></li>
<li><p>The general shape of the soundscape within the space - in this case, Russell Sq is almost entirely in the pleasant half but is split relatively evenly across the eventfulness space, meaning while it is perceived as generally pleasant, it is not strongly calm or vibrant;</p></li>
<li><p>The degree of agreement about the soundscape perception among the sample - there appears to be a relatively high agreement about the character of Russell Sq, as demonstrated by the compactness of the distribution, but this is not the case for every location.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Figure&nbsp;2 (a) includes several in-depth visualisations of the distribution of soundscape assessments, however the detail included can make further analysis difficult. In particular, a decile heatmap is so visually busy that, in our experience, it is not possible to plot more than one soundscape distribution at a time without the figure becoming overly busy. It also can make it difficult to truly grasp point 2, the general shape of the soundscape. To facilitate this, the soundscape can be represented by its 50th percentile contour, as demonstrated in Figure&nbsp;2 (b) where the shaded portion contains 50% of the responses. This simplified view of the distribution presents several advantages, as is demonstrated in Figure&nbsp;2 (c) and Figure&nbsp;2 (d) and takes inspiration from the recommendation in the ISO standard to use the median as a summary statistic. In our testing, the 50th percentile contour has proved useful, clear, and compact, however this should not be taken as the definitive correct percentile cutoff. Further work will need to be done to validate the precise presentation.</p>
<p>When visualised this way, it is possible to identify outliers and responses which are the result of anomalous sound events. For instance if during a survey session at a calm park, a fleet of helicopters flies overhead, driving the participants to respond that the soundscape is highly chaotic, we would see a group of scatter points in the chaotic quadrant which appear obviously outside the general pattern of responses. Often, these responses would be entirely discarded as outliers or the surveys and soundwalks would be halted entirely – ignoring what is in fact a significant impact on that location, its soundscape, and how useful it may be for the community. Alternatively, they would be naively included within the statistical analysis, significantly impacting the central tendency and dispersion metrics (i.e.&nbsp;median and range) without consideration for the context. This is the situation shown in Figure&nbsp;2 (b) where it is obvious that there is strong agreement that Regents Park Fields is highly pleasant and calm, however we can see numerous responses which assessed it as highly chaotic. These responses were taken when a series of military helicopter flyovers drastically changed the sound environment of the space for several minutes.</p>
<p>Figure&nbsp;2 (c) demonstrates how this simplified 50th percentile contour representation makes it possible to compare the soundscape of several locations in a sophisticated way. The soundscape assessments of three urban spaces, Camden Town, Pancras Lock, and Russell Square, are shown overlaid with each other. We can see that Camden Town, a busy and crowded street corner with high levels of traffic noise and amplified music, is generally perceived as chaotic, but the median contour shape which characterises it also crosses over into the vibrant quadrant. We can also see that, for a part of the sample, Russell Square and Pancras Lock are both perceived as similarly pleasant, however some portion of the responses perceived Pancras Lock as being somewhat chaotic and annoying. This kind of visualisation can highlight these similarities between the soundscapes in the locations and identify how they differ. From here, further investigation could lead us to answer what factors led to those people perceiving the location as unpleasant, and what similarities the soundscape of Pancras Lock has with Russell Square that could perhaps be enhanced to increase the proportion of people perceiving it as more pleasant.</p>
<p>In addition to solely analysing the distributions of the perceptual responses themselves, this method can also be combined with other acoustic, environmental, and contextual data. The final example, in Figure&nbsp;2 (d) demonstrates how this method can better demonstrate the complex relationships between acoustic features of the sound environment and the soundscape perception. The data in the ISD includes ~30-s-long binaural audio recordings taken while each participant was responding to the soundscape survey, providing an indication of the exact sound environment they were exposed to. For Figure&nbsp;2 (d) the entire dataset of 1,338 responses at all 13 locations has been split according to the analysis of these recordings giving a set of less than 65 dB <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D"> and a set of more than 65 dB. The bivariate distributions of these two conditions are then plotted.</p>
<p>By presenting soundscape perception as a bivariate distributional shape on the circumplex, practitioners are obligated to address two key aspects of perception that are too often ignored: the distribution of potential responses and the eventful dimension. The array of potential responses to an environment is a crucial factor in assessing the successful design of a space and represents the reality of perception. There is no single perceptual outcome of an environment; it will always include some randomness inherent in human perception and this should be reflected in how we present soundscape assessments. Similarly, the eventful dimension is crucial to understanding how an environment is perceived and can have important impacts on the health and well-being of the users. Recent evidence also suggests that there is a more direct relationship between acoustic characteristics and the perception of eventfulness, while pleasantness is more dependent on context <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021Investigating">(Mitchell, Oberman, Aletta, Kachlicka, et al. 2021)</span>. Studies that explore the correlations between acoustic features and annoyance (or pleasantness) without considering eventfulness are perhaps missing the most direct effect of the acoustic features.</p>

<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Making Use of the Soundscape Circumplex</h1>
<p>There are various potential methods for integrating the probabilistic soundscape approach into a design and intervention setting. Representing the soundscape as a shape within the circumplex provides flexibility in setting design goals for a space. Not all spaces can or should have the same soundscape and soundscapes should be treated as dynamic, not static; identifying and creating an appropriate soundscape for the particular use case of a space is crucial to guiding its design. Proper forward-looking design of a soundscape would involve defining the desired shape and distribution of perceptions in the space. This can be achieved by drawing the desired shape in the circumplex and testing interventions which will bring the existing soundscape closer to the desired perception. A soundscape may need to be perceived as vibrant during the day and calm for some portion of the evening, meaning the desired shape should primarily sit within the vibrant quadrant but have some overlap into calm. This also enables designers to recognise the limitations of their environment and acknowledge that it is not always possible to transform a highly chaotic soundscape into a calm one. In these cases, instead the focus should be placed on shifting the distribution to some degree in a positive direction. The most sophisticated method of setting design goals is therefore to identify the desired shape which represents the variety of desired outcomes, and focus on designs and interventions which are most successful in matching the predicted outcome with that goal.</p>
<p>Although the visualisations shown in Figure&nbsp;2 are a powerful tool for viewing, analysing, and discussing the multi-dimensional aspects of soundscape perception, there are certainly cases where simpler metrics are needed to aid discussion and to set design goals. For this, the underlying process of calculating the ISOPleasant and ISOEventful coordinates for each individual response is still the first step in analysing the quantitative soundscape data. These sets of coordinates can then be analysed and summarised in various ways. One approach which takes inspiration from noise annoyance <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO15666">(ISO/TS 15666:2021 2021)</span>, is to discuss the “percent of people likely to perceive” a soundscape as pleasant, vibrant, etc. when it is necessary to use numerical descriptions. In this way, a numerical design goal could also be set as e.g.&nbsp;‘the soundscape should be likely to be perceived as pleasant by at least 75% of users’ or the result of an intervention presented as e.g.&nbsp;‘the likelihood of the soundscape being perceived as calm increased from 30% to 55%’. These numbers can be drawn from either actual surveys or from the results of predictive models.</p>
<p>Although acknowledging the distribution of responses is crucial, it is sometimes necessary to summarise locations down to a single point to compare many different locations and to easily investigate how the soundscape assessment has generally changed over time. For this purpose, the mean of the ISOPleasant and ISOEventful values across all respondents is calculated to result in a single coordinate point per location. This clearly mirrors the original intent of the coordinate transformation presented in the ISO, but by applying the transformation first to each individual assessment then calculating the mean value, it maintains a direct link to the distributions shown in Figure&nbsp;2. An example plot using the mean response of each location to compare many locations and to demonstrate change in soundscape perception can be found in Figure 5 of <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021Investigating">Mitchell, Oberman, Aletta, Kachlicka, et al. (2021)</span>. The key to all of these analysis methods, whether they be the distributional plots shown in Figure&nbsp;2, the numerical summaries, or the use of other standard statistical analyses is treating the soundscape of the space or group as a collective perception as expressed by a vector of individual circumplex coordinates.</p>
<p>Finally, the primary concern addressed by this method is the analysis of larger soundscape datasets, compared to what is suggested in the standard. This is necessary in order to statistically describe the groups or sub-groups being investigated, and is typically taken to need a minimum of ~30 responses per group (although the full dataset, made up of many groups and locations may have many more responses in total, as in the ISD) <span class="citation" data-cites="Hong2015Influence PuyanaRomero2016Modelling">(e.g. Hong and Jeon 2015; Puyana Romero et al. 2016)</span>. It is unlikely that the bivariate distributions plots shown are appropriate for small datasets. However, the process of calculating the ISO coordinates for each individual response and treating this as a set of continuous values to subject to other statistical analysis holds for all sample sizes. Pleasant-eventful scatterplots are still useful for comparing differences in individual responses and appropriate methods of summarising small sample data should be explored (such as the univariate scatterplots described in <span class="citation" data-cites="Weissgerber2015Bar">Weissgerber et al. (2015)</span>).</p>

<p>The method presented here is a solution for representing the soundscape of a space, which requires considering the perception of many people, but it is important to note that this is only one (very important) goal of the soundscape approach. Psychological and sociological investigations of people’s relationship to their sound environment and the interactions between social contexts and individual perception are a crucial aspect of the field for which this approach would likely not be sufficient <span class="citation" data-cites="Bild2018Public">(Bild et al. 2018)</span>. Open-response questions, structured interviews, and mixed-methods studies can provide additional insight into how people experience their environment and should be considered alongside or preceding this focus on how a space is likely to be perceived on a larger scale.</p>
<p>These other approaches are not in opposition to the methods proposed here, but instead further expand our view. The circumplex is a limited view of soundscape perception (this is made obvious by the fact that it excludes the third component, <em>familiarity</em>, identified in <span class="citation" data-cites="Axelsson2010Principal">Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund (2010)</span>) but it is an exceptionally rich tool for dealing with the two primary aspects of soundscape perception which can readily expand the much more limited view provided by existing noise and annoyance assessment tools. Aspects of the psychological and sociological emphasis can also be integrated into a circumplex-focused approach, as demonstrated in <span class="citation" data-cites="Erfanian2021Psychological">Erfanian et al. (2021)</span>, where personal factors such as age, gender, and psychological well-being were analysed in terms of how they mediated the ISOPleasant and ISOEventful outcomes.</p>
<p>There has been some discussion regarding the interdependence of the PAs and the strict validity of the 90<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ccirc"> and 45<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ccirc"> relationships between the attributes <span class="citation" data-cites="Lionello2021Introducing">(Lionello et al. 2021)</span>. Further work has indicated that the scaling between the attributes may vary, but the underlying relationships hold. It is for this reason that we have taken the coordinate projection as the starting point of this critique. It should also be noted that the particular PA descriptors used in ISO 12913 are intended for outdoor environments and should not be directly applied to indoor spaces. However, a proposed set of descriptors for some indoor environments has been derived which further confirms the validity of the circumplex relationships <span class="citation" data-cites="Torresin2020Indoor">(Torresin et al. 2020)</span>. The methods proposed here should be directly applicable to indoor spaces by using the comfort/content descriptors as well as to any other translations of soundscape descriptors into other languages <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2020Soundscape">(Aletta et al. 2020)</span> as long as the dimensional relationships of the circumplex are maintained.</p>

<p>Soundscape studies have been steadily growing as a research field over the past three decades. Their relevance for the planning and design of urban spaces is now generally acknowledged by both the academic and practitioners’ communities. Yet, for their contribution in shaping better environments to be meaningful, it is necessary to agree on common methodological approaches and techniques to analyse and present standardised soundscape data. Therefore, the general goal of this work is to consider some of the questions that may still have been left unanswered by the ISO 12913 series when it comes to optimal ways to analyse and represent soundscape data coming from the ISO standardised protocols. As a result, we propose a method for presenting the results of standardised assessments as a distribution of soundscape perception within the circumplex space. This method provides an opportunity to conduct a nuanced discussion of soundscape perception which considers the variety of individual responses. The tools for generating these circumplex visualisations are made openly available as well. This shift is part of a move towards a more holistic approach to urban noise and to integrating the soundscape approach into urban design and regulations.</p>

<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-intro"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The global emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 required national lockdown measures across the world, primarily targeting human activity. In the United Kingdom, construction and transport were allowed to continue, but a decrease in activity was observed <span class="citation" data-cites="Hadjidemetriou2020impact">(Hadjidemetriou et al. 2020)</span>. In other countries, such as Italy, the restrictions were more severe and even included limiting people’s movement to a certain radius from their place of residence <span class="citation" data-cites="Ren2020Pandemic">(Ren 2020)</span>. The explorations in environmental acoustics of lockdown conditions across the world have revealed various degrees of impact on the acoustic environment, with researchers reporting reductions in noise levels affecting the population at the scale of urban agglomerations such as Ruhr Area in Germany <span class="citation" data-cites="Hornberg2021Impact">(Hornberg et al. 2021)</span> and conurbations in the south of France <span class="citation" data-cites="Munoz2020Lockdown">(Munoz et al. 2020)</span>. Impacts have also been reported at a scale of a multimillion city such as Madrid <span class="citation" data-cites="Asensio2020Changes">(Asensio, Pavón, and Arcas 2020)</span> or Barcelona <span class="citation" data-cites="BonetSola2021Soundscape">(Bonet-Solà et al. 2021)</span> as well as at a more local, city-center or even public space-scale in cities such as Stockholm <span class="citation" data-cites="Rumpler2021Noise">(Rumpler, Venkataraman, and Göransson 2021)</span>, London <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2020Assessing">(Aletta et al. 2020)</span>, Girona <span class="citation" data-cites="AlsinaPages2021Changes">(Alsina-Pagès, Bergadà, and Martı́nez-Suquı́a 2021)</span>, or Granada <span class="citation" data-cites="VidaManzano2021sound">(Vida Manzano et al. 2021)</span>. In general, these studies have demonstrated a decrease in urban noise levels and indicated a difference in the amount the level decreased depending on the type of space investigated (e.g.&nbsp;parks, urban squares, etc.) and the type of human activity characteristic for the space, with higher reductions in places typically associated with human sounds and activities such as shopping and tourism.</p>
<p>Those studies were mostly focused around the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D">, as well as a standardization approach to reporting subsequent changes in soundscape proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Asensio2020Taxonomy">Asensio et al. (2020)</span>. They were not able to reveal the perceptual impact of such conditions in public spaces also because of: 1) the lack of subjective data for the exact or comparable locations in previous years; and 2) the lack of participants present in public spaces during the lockdown, hence the inability to collect soundscape data in situ. <span class="citation" data-cites="Munoz2020Lockdown">Munoz et al. (2020)</span> combined noise measurements with an online questionnaire deployed to residents, some of which were residing in the areas covered by the noise monitoring network available. The participants were asked to recall how their lockdown area sounded before and during the first lockdown in 2020 and to describe the perceived change. They observed a consistent reduction in levels, followed by the perceived reduction of transport sounds (air and road) and an increase of natural sounds, while the resulting environment was described as pleasant, calm, and peaceful. By combining field recordings and focus groups, <span class="citation" data-cites="Sakagami2020How">Sakagami (2020)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Lenzi2021Soundscape">Lenzi, Sádaba, and Lindborg (2021)</span> observed changes in the sound source composition and the affective quality of soundscape in a residential area in Kobe, Japan and a public space in Getxa, Spain, respectively, during the different stages of the lockdown period. Following the easing of lockdown measures, a decrease in animal and traffic sounds was observed in Kobe, while an increase in eventfulness, loudness, and presence of human sound sources, followed by a decrease in pleasantness, was shown in Getxa.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2020Assessing">Aletta et al. (2020)</span> explored the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdowns on the acoustic environment in London in particular, through many short-term (30s) binaural recordings. This study revealed that average reductions in the various locations considered ranged from 10.7 dB (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D">) to 1.2 dB, with an overall average reduction of 5.4 dB. This metric-reporting focused approach left the following research questions unanswered: how would people have perceived these spaces as a result of this change in acoustic environment (RQ1), and would these sound level reductions result in improvements to the soundscape of the spaces (RQ2)? The 1st research question (RQ1), addressing the perceptual effect of the change in urban soundscape induced by the lockdowns, can be further broken down into the following questions: how was the sound source composition influenced by the change; how would the affective response to the acoustic environment in lockdowns change; and could this demonstrate the effect of human activities on the perception of an acoustic environment in general?</p>
<p>These questions arise out of the soundscape approach, which is characterized by prioritizing the perceptual effect of an acoustic environment by taking into account the interaction of sound sources, context, and the person perceiving it <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part1 Truax1999Handbook">(ISO 12913-1:2014 2014; Truax 1999)</span>, bringing together objective and subjective factors. The soundscape approach to noise mitigation and management is being recognized as a response to arising environmental requirements on noise pollution and sustainability, such as the regulation of quiet areas in Europe <span class="citation" data-cites="EuropeanUnion2002Directive Kang2018Impact Radicchi2021Sound">(European Union 2002; Kang and Aletta 2018; Radicchi et al. 2021)</span>. This has been further formalized in <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part2">ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018)</span> via the adoption of the circumplex model of soundscape <span class="citation" data-cites="Axelsson2010principal">(Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2010)</span>, in which the perception of a soundscape can be described in terms of its pleasantness and eventfulness, as one of the standard methods of soundscape assessment.</p>
<p>Soundscape research is therefore traditionally rooted in environmental acoustics and environmental psychology, typically dealing with outdoor spaces <span class="citation" data-cites="Torresin2020Indoor">(Torresin et al. 2020)</span> and urban open spaces, where parks and squares are often used as case study sites <span class="citation" data-cites="Kang2006Urban">(Kang 2006)</span>. A soundscape assessment typically requires people to be surveyed but the presence of people at a location influences assessment <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2018Towards">(Aletta and Kang 2018)</span> and ‘quiet places’ usually require low numbers of users to remain quiet, which limits the possibility of an assessment. Even in a crowded public space, soundscape surveys are demanding as they require significant resources to carry out at scale, limiting their widespread application <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2020Soundscape">(Mitchell et al. 2020)</span>. Therefore, a need for a predictive model arises to overcome this limitation and improve the implementation of the soundscape approach into everyday planning and management practices.</p>
<p>According to a recent review of predictive soundscape models from <span class="citation" data-cites="Lionello2020systematic">Lionello, Aletta, and Kang (2020)</span>, the degree of employing auditory and non-auditory factors in soundscape prediction varies with some studies relying on contextual, personal/demographic <span class="citation" data-cites="Erfanian2021Psychological Tarlao2020Investigating">(Erfanian et al. 2021; Tarlao, Steffens, and Guastavino 2020)</span> or social media <span class="citation" data-cites="Aiello2016Chatty">(Aiello et al. 2016)</span> data entirely to predict and generate soundscape features. Some methods also incorporate perceptually-derived features, such as subjective sound level and visual pleasantness as predictors <span class="citation" data-cites="Lionello2020systematic">(Lionello, Aletta, and Kang 2020)</span>. In general, these methods which incorporate perceptually-derived inputs achieve better accuracy rates than those which don’t, however this perception information must also be obtained from people via a survey and therefore are unsuitable for predictive modeling where surveys are not possible. For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="Ricciardi2015Sound">Ricciardi et al. (2015)</span> proposed two models based on data collected from a smartphone application to predict urban sound quality indicators based on linear regressions. The first model which incorporated perceptually-derived input features (visual quality and familiarity) achieved an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> of 0.72, while a second model without these features achieved an <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> of 0.58. This indicates the necessity for considering and accounting for the influence which contextual factors in a space have on the relationship between the sound environment itself and the listener’s perception of it (i.e.&nbsp;the soundscape) while also highlighting the challenges associated with a predictive model which depends only on measurable features.</p>
<p>Therefore, a third research question arises: what are the key features needed for a soundscape prediction model based on comprehensive acoustic on-site measurements to be used for assessing locations with low social presence or in situations where conducting surveys is impractical (RQ3)?</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="materials-and-methods"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Materials and methods</h2>
<p>This study was conducted via initial onsite data collection campaigns in Central London and Venice in 2019 before the outbreak of COVID-19 as part of the Soundscape Indices (SSID) project <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2020Soundscape">(Mitchell et al. 2020)</span> and in 2020 during the strictest part of the lockdowns <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2020Assessing">(Aletta et al. 2020)</span>, including objective acoustic data (2019 and 2020) and subjective responses (2019 only). The full in situ dataset, as described in this section, has been made publicly available as ‘The International Soundscape Database (V0.2.1)’ on Zenodo<sup>1</sup><span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2021International">(Mitchell et al. 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Using both 2019 and 2020 binaural recordings, an online listening experiment was conducted to provide an understanding about the change in sound source composition. The 2019 onsite questionnaire data were used to define the dominant sound source at each location as a starting point for interpreting soundscape change. A predictive model was developed to reveal the change in the perceived pleasantness and eventfulness using objective acoustic data and location to predict subjective responses. Although the initial (2019) dataset contains additional locations (specifically, in Spain, the Netherlands, and China), due to the nature of this study as a reaction to the strict movement and activity restrictions, the sites which could be included in the lockdown (2020) measurement campaigns were limited to locations where staff and equipment had access and where recordings could be undertaken during the spring of 2020.</p>
<p>The sites were selected to provide a mixture of sizes and uses, varying in typology ranging from paved squares to small and large parks to waterside spaces across both cities. Throughout the text they are indexed via a LocationID based on the location’s name (e.g.&nbsp;CamdenTown, SanMarco), while a more in-depth overview of each is given in supplementary material<sup>2</sup>. London is taken as an example of a large, typically noisy city while the Venice sample provides a unique look at spaces with typically very high human activity levels and no road traffic activity. In particular, the 2019 Venice surveys were taken to coincide with the yearly Carnevale festival in order to capture its distinct soundscape.</p>
<p>The ISO/TS 12913 <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part2">(ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 2018)</span> series were consulted for reporting on soundscape data. A detailed description of the 2019 survey campaigns is featured throughout the paper and in the public database. This study was approved by departmental UCL IEDE Ethics Committee on 17th July 2018 for onsite data collection and on the 2nd of June 2020 for the on-line listening experiment and is conducted in adherence to the ethical requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki <span class="citation" data-cites="WMA2013World">(World Medical Association 2013)</span>.</p>

<p>The initial onsite data collection featured both questionnaire data collected from the general public and acoustic measurements, conducted across thirteen urban locations (in London <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N=11">, in Venice <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N=2">) between the 28th of February and the 21st of June 2019, with additional sessions in July and October 2019. Although the total survey period in 2019 extended over several seasons, the surveys at any individual location did not extend over seasons with different occupancy patterns. A total of 1,318 questionnaire responses were collected from the general population across the measurement points during 1 – 3 hour-long campaigns in both cities in 2019, accompanied by 693 approximately 30-second long 24-bit 44.1 kHz binaural recordings. After data cleaning, each of the 13 locations was characterized by between 14 to 80 recordings and between 24 to 147 questionnaire responses. Mean age of the participants was 33.8, with a standard deviation of 14.57 (45% male, 53.8% female, 0.4% non-conforming, 0.9% prefer-not-to-say).</p>
<p>Although recent results from both <span class="citation" data-cites="Tarlao2020Investigating">Tarlao, Steffens, and Guastavino (2020)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Erfanian2021Psychological">Erfanian et al. (2021)</span> indicate the important influence of personal and demographic factors – in particular age and gender – on soundscape perception, these factors were not included as potential features in the modeling process. Given the nature of this study as addressing a scenario when people could not be surveyed, no additional demographic information is available in the lockdown case to be fed into the model and is therefore not useful to include for the development and application of this specific predictive model. This information is reported throughout the study simply to provide further context to the data collection.</p>
<p>The subsequent measurement campaign in 2020 mimicked the binaural recording strategy applied in the initial campaign and was performed between the 6th and the 25th of April 2020 in both cities, this time excluding the questionnaire. An additional 571 binaural recordings were collected on-site in 2020.</p>
<section id="data-collection" class="level4" data-number="2.1.1">
<h4 data-number="2.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-collection"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Data collection</h4>
<p>The 2019 data collection was performed across all the locations using the protocol based on the Method A of the <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part2">ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018)</span>, as described in <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2020Assessing">Aletta et al. (2020)</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2020Soundscape">Mitchell et al. (2020)</span>, collected either via handheld tablets or paper copies of the questionnaire. The full questionnaire and data collection procedure are given in <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2020Soundscape">Mitchell et al. (2020)</span>, however the key parts used for this study are those addressing sound source dominance and perceived affective quality (PAQ).</p>
<p>Participants are first asked to rate the perceived dominance of several sound sources, as assessed via a 5-point Likert scale, coded from 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Dominates completely). The sound sources are split into four categories: Traffic noise, Other noise, Human sounds, and Natural sounds and each is rated separately. Next are the 8 PAQs which make up the circumplex model of soundscape <span class="citation" data-cites="Axelsson2010principal">(Axelsson, Nilsson, and Berglund 2010)</span>: pleasant, chaotic, vibrant, uneventful, calm, annoying, eventful, and monotonous. These are assessed on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree). In order to simplify the results and allow for modeling the responses as continuous values, the 8 PAQs undergo a trigonometric projection to reduce them onto the two primary dimensions of pleasant and eventful, according to the procedure outlined in Part 3 of the ISO 12913 series <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part3">(ISO/TS 12913-3:2019 2019)</span>. In order to distinguish the projected values from the Likert-scale PAQ responses, the projected values will be referred to as ISOPleasant and ISOEventful and can be considered to form an x-y coordinate point (x = ISOPleasant, y = ISOEventful) as explained in detail in <span class="citation" data-cites="Lionello2021Introducing">Lionello et al. (2021)</span>.</p>
<p>The calibrated binaural device SQobold with BHS II by Head Acoustics was used in both campaigns at all the locations by various operators to capture acoustic data, as mentioned in the acknowledgments. Following the established onsite protocol <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2020Soundscape">(Mitchell et al. 2020)</span>, when participants were stopped in a group and filled in their responses simultaneously, a single binaural recording was used to capture their experience as a group. The purpose behind this sampling strategy was to obtain data from the perspective of a typical user, corresponding to a range of individual experiences available within an urban open space. These recordings are indexed by a GroupID such that the recording for each group is matched up to each of the corresponding respondents and their individual survey responses.</p>

<h4 data-number="2.1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-cleaning"><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Data cleaning</h4>
<p>The cleaning of the samples was conducted using the ArtemiS SUITE 11. The researcher discarded or cropped whole recordings, or its parts affected by wind gusts or containing noises and speech generated by the recording operator by accident or for the purpose of explaining the questionnaire to a participant. This resulted in 1,258 binaural recordings then processed further, as described in Section&nbsp;2.1.3. Psychoacoustic analyses are shown in the publicly available database<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>In order to maintain data quality and exclude cases where respondents either clearly did not understand the PAQ adjectives or intentionally misrepresented their answers, surveys for which the same response was given for every PAQ (e.g.&nbsp;‘Strongly agree’ to all 8 attributes) were excluded prior to calculating the ISO projected values. This is justified as no reasonable respondent who understood the questions would answer that they ‘strongly agree’ that a soundscape is pleasant and annoying, calm and chaotic, etc. Cases where respondents answered ‘Neutral’ to all PAQs are not excluded in this way, as a neutral response to all attributes is not necessarily contradictory. In addition, surveys were discarded as incomplete if more than 50% of the PAQ and sound source questions were not completed.</p>
<p>The site characterization per <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part2">ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018)</span> is available in the supplementary material<sup>4</sup> and public database<sup>5</sup>, featuring the address, overall psychoacoustic characteristics of the location, typical use of each location, and pictures taken during the survey sessions.</p>

<p>The binaural recordings were analyzed in ArtemiS SUITE 11 to calculate the suite of 11 acoustic and psychoacoustic features given in Table&nbsp;1 to be used as initial predictors. The (psycho)acoustic predictors investigated were selected in order to describe many aspects of the recorded sound – in particular, the goal was to move beyond a focus on sound level, which currently dominates the existing literature on the acoustic effects of lockdowns noted in Section&nbsp;1. In all, they are expected to reflect the sound level (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D">), perceived sound level (Loudness), spectral content (Sharpness, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BCeq%7D-L_%7BAeq%7D">, Tonality), temporal character or predictability (Impulsiveness, Fluctuation Strength, Relative Approach), and overall annoyance (Psychoacoustic Annoyance). These metrics have been proposed as indicators to predict perceptual constructs of the soundscape <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2016Soundscape Aletta2017Dimensions">(Aletta, Kang, and Axelsson 2016; Aletta, Axelsson, and Kang 2017)</span> and have shown promise when combined together to form a more comprehensive model applied to real-world sounds <span class="citation" data-cites="Orga2021Multilevel">(Orga et al. 2021)</span>. The maximum value from the left and right channels of the binaural recording are used, as suggested in <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part3">ISO/TS 12913-3:2019 (2019)</span>.</p>

<p>Table&nbsp;2 shows the Pearson correlation coefficient between each of the candidate acoustic features and the outcome pleasantness and eventfulness. As all variables considered are continuous, and the eventual model is linear, the Pearson coefficient is chosen as a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two continuous variables. For ISOPleasant (<em>ISOPl</em>), we can perhaps see three tiers of correlations: the more highly correlated tier <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%7Cr%7C%20%3E%200.28)"> consists of Relative Approach (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?RA">), <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D">, Roughness (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R">), Loudness (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_5">), and Psychoacoustic Annoyance (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?PA">); the low correlation tier consists of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BA10%7D-L_%7BA90%7D">, Tonality (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T">), and Fluctuation Strength (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?FS">); while <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BCeq%7D-L_%7BAeq%7D">, Impulsiveness (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I">), and Sharpness (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">) show no correlation.

<p>Among the inter-correlations for the psychoacoustic metrics considered for inclusion as input features, we can see several very highly correlated features (i.e.&nbsp;<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%3E0.9">). As expected, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?PA">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_5"> are highly correlated, meaning that careful consideration is paid to these features to ensure they do not contribute to multicollinearity in the final model.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="modelling"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Modelling</h3>
<p>Two linear multi-level models (MLM) were computed to predict: 1) ISOPleasant, and 2) ISOEventful. These models are trained on the 2019 data only, then applied to the acoustic data collected during the 2020 lockdowns, the results of which are reported in Section&nbsp;3.2.3. The inherent grouped structure of the SSID database necessitates a modeling and analysis approach which considers the differing relationships between the objective acoustic features and the soundscape’s perceived affective quality ratings across the various locations and contexts. The individual-level of the models is made up of the acoustic features calculated from the binaural recordings made during each respondent’s survey period, while the group-level includes the categorical <code>LocationID</code> variable indicating the location in which the survey was taken, acting as a non-auditory contextual factor.</p>
<p>A separate backwards-step feature selection was performed for each of the outcome models in order to identify the minimal feature set to be used for predicting each outcome. In this feature selection process, an initial model containing all of the candidate features was fit. Each feature was then removed from the model one at a time, then the best-performing model is selected and the procedure continues step-wise until no improvement is seen by removing more features. This process is carried out first on the location-level features (including the potential to remove all features including LocationID, resulting in a ‘flat’ or standard multivariate linear regression model), then on the individual-level features. The performance criterion used for this process was the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) <span class="citation" data-cites="Akaike1974new">(Akaike 1974)</span>. To check for multicollinearity among the selected features, the variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated and a threshold of VIF &lt;5 was set. Any features which remained after the backwards stepwise selection and which exceeded this threshold were investigated and removed if they were highly collinear with the other features.</p>
<p>All of the input features are numeric values, in the units described above. Before conducting feature selection, the input features are z-scaled to enable proper comparison of their effect sizes. After the feature selection, the scaled coefficients are used in the text when reporting the final fitted models to facilitate discussion and comparison between the features. The unscaled model coefficients are reported in <strong>?@sec-appmod</strong> to enable the models to be applied to new data. In order to properly assess the predictive performance of the model, an 80/20 train-test split with a balanced shuffle across LocationIDs was used. The z-scaling and feature selection was performed on the training set only, in order to prevent data leakage. To score the performance of the model on the training and testing sets, we use the mean absolute error (MAE), which is in the scale of the response feature - for ISOPleasant this means our response can range from -1 to +1. However, since the end-goal of the model is to predict the soundscape assessment of the location as a whole, rather than the individual responses, we also assess the performance of the model in predicting the average response in each location. To do this, the mean response value for each location is calculated, and the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2"> accuracy across LocationIDs is reported for both the training and testing sets.</p>
<p>The model fitting and feature selection was performed using the <code>step</code> function from <code>lmerTest</code> (v3.1.3) <span class="citation" data-cites="Kuznetsova2017lmerTest">(Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, and Christensen 2017)</span> in R statistical software (v4.0.3) <span class="citation" data-cites="RCT2018R">(R Core Team 2018)</span>. The summaries and plots were created using the <code>sjPlot</code> package (v2.8.6) <span class="citation" data-cites="Luedecke2021sjPlot">(Lüdecke 2021)</span> and <code>seaborn</code> (v0.11.1) <span class="citation" data-cites="Waskom2021seaborn">(Waskom 2021)</span>.</p>

<h3 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="online-survey"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Online survey</h3>
<p>An online listening test was conducted using the Gorilla Experiment Builder<sup>6</sup> <span class="citation" data-cites="AnwylIrvine2019Gorilla">(Anwyl-Irvine et al. 2019)</span>. The participants were exposed to a random selection of 78 binaural recordings (39 from 2019 and 39 from 2020, 6 recordings per each location). Each participant had the option to evaluate either 1 or 2 sets of 6 recordings randomly assigned between 13 stimuli sets. Mp3 files, converted at 256 kBps were used due to the requirements of the Gorilla platform.</p>
<p>No visual stimuli were used in the experiment. The experiment consisted of: 1) an initial exercise to enhance chances of participants complying to the instructions and wearing headphones; 2) a training set using two randomly chosen binaural recordings (then not used in the main task) from the dataset; 3) a soundscape characterization questionnaire starting with an open-ended question about perceived sound sources and featuring the same questions as the one used in situ, looking into the perceived affective quality of the soundscape and the perceived sound source dominance of the following four types: traffic noise, other noise, human sounds and natural sounds; 4) a questionnaire on the basic demographic factors. The questionnaire used in the Part 3 of the online experiment is reported in Appendix A.</p>
<p>Having in mind the remote nature of the study and to ensure a minimum level of robustness for reliable sound source recognition, an initial exercise was performed consisting of a headphone screening test <span class="citation" data-cites="Woods2017Headphone">(Woods et al. 2017)</span> and a headphone reproduction level adjustment test <span class="citation" data-cites="Gontier2019Estimation">(Gontier et al. 2019)</span>. The level adjustment was performed using an eleven-second-long pink noise sample matched to the lowest and the highest <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BA90%7D"> values from the experimental set. Participants were asked to adjust their listening level to clearly hear the quieter sample while keeping the level low enough, so they don’t find the louder sample disturbing. The headphones screening test followed, featuring a stereo signal of one-second-long 100 Hz sine tone, generated with Izotope RX 6 application, played at a 3 dB difference where one of the equally loud pairs had its phase inverted. A 100 Hz sine was used because the pilot tests revealed the 200 Hz sine tone proposed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Woods2017Headphone">Woods et al. (2017)</span> created a higher uncertainty varying across different laptop models and would likely contribute to the chances of a participant fooling the test. It was expected that participants using speakers would not be able to either hear the sine wave or would be fooled by the inverted phase effect and therefore not able to pass the trials, unless they were indeed using headphones. The participant needed to recognize the quietest of the 3 samples in a trial of 6 attempts. Only participants correctly answering 5 or more out of 6 trials were allowed to proceed with the experiment. Participants were asked not to change their audio output settings during the rest of the experiment. (This was introduced to ensure that a participant is using a headphones playback system which allows a listener to clearly recognize a 3 dB difference at 100 Hz as a proxy for sufficient audio quality playback.)</p>
<p>However, after the initial data collection, questions were raised as to how the playback loudness impacts ecological validity as it relates to the perceived affective quality of the soundscape. Given this concern, the PAQ responses from the online surveys were not included in further data analysis. Sound source identification is not considered to suffer the same validity concerns as this is not directly dependent on absolute playback level and requires only that the participant can clearly hear what is present. The purpose of the calibration procedure described above was to ensure the participant could clearly hear the softest samples used.</p>
<p>Online questionnaire data was collected between the 9th of June and the 9th of August 2020. Within the Gorilla Experiment Builder, a total of 250 attempts to complete the experiment were recorded, where 165 participants were excluded either on the basis of not passing the headphones screening (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N=79">) or for not completing the experiment, usually before engaging into the screening (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N=83">). Out of a total of 88 participants who completed the test, 2 participants were excluded as outliers as they provided uniform answers across all the questions and commented on not being able to properly hear the stimuli, despite their successful completion of the training tests. The participants of the online experiment were of mean age 32.42, 45.1% male, 54.9% female.</p>

<p>The results of the onsite surveys, online experiment, and the model development are reported here.

<p>Questionnaire data was collected in English, Italian, and Spanish in both cities. The respective questionnaires can be found in the supplementary files and <span class="citation" data-cites="Mitchell2020Soundscape">Mitchell et al. (2020)</span>. Data presented here was aggregated per LocationID.</p>
<p>According to the highest scored mean value of the dominant sound source type, as shown in Figure&nbsp;2, the locations can be grouped into: natural sounds dominated (RegentsParkJapan, RegentsParkFields, RussellSq), human sounds dominated (SanMarco, TateModern, StPaulsRow, StPaulsCross, MonumentoGaribaldi), noise (traffic and other noise) sounds dominated (CamdenTown, EustonTap, TorringtonSq, PancrasLock). Traffic noise and Other noise have been combined here, and for the rest of the discussion, as these responses are highly correlated within this dataset and it is not helpful to consider them separately for this analysis. This follows the alternative sound source labels given in Figure C.3 of <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part2">ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018)</span> which combines Traffic and Other Noise. Finally, MarchmontGarden is unique in that all sound source types are assessed as being nearly equally present, with only 0.2 separating the least present (Other noise, 2.5) and the most present (Traffic noise, 2.7).</p>

<p>The results from the listening tests deployed online were analyzed using the SPSS Statistics v. 25. Levene’s test for equality of variances resulted in highly statistically significant values for all 4 sound sources investigated (less than 0.001). Therefore, a Mann-Whitney U-test test was used as a non-parametric equivalent to the T-test to investigate the change in the perceived dominance of the four sound source types <span class="citation" data-cites="McKnight2010Mann">(McKnight and Najab 2010)</span>. The results for human sounds indicated that the perceived dominance was greater for the 2019 sample (M=3.82), than for the 2020 sample (M=2.62), U=41,656, p &lt; 0.001. The results for natural sounds indicated the perceived dominance increased from 2019 (M=2.00) to 2020 (M=2.54), U=63,797, p &lt; 0.001. However, the differences for the noise sources (traffic and other) were not statistically significant. The result of these changes is that while Human sounds were the clearly dominant source across the whole dataset in 2019, in 2020 the sound sources are, on average, much more evenly balanced. No single sound source category was identified as frequent across the 2020 dataset.</p>

<p>Following the feature selection, the ISOPleasant model (given in Table&nbsp;4) has <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N_5"> as the fixed effect with a scaled coefficient of -0.06, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BA10%7D-L_%7BA90%7D">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BCeq%7D-L_%7BAeq%7D"> as coefficients which vary depending on the LocationID. The training and testing MAE are very similar, indicating that the model is neither over- nor under-fitting to the training data (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?MAE_%7Btrain%7D%20=%200.258">; <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?MAE_%7Btest%7D%20=%200.259">). The model performs very well at predicting the average soundscape assessment of the locations (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2_%7Btrain%7D%20=%200.998">; <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2_%7Btest%7D%20=%200.85">).</p>
<p>The high intraclass correlation (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?ICC%20=%200.90">) demonstrates that the location-level effects are highly important in predicting the pleasantness dimension. Within this random-intercept random-slope model structure, these effects include both the specific context of the location (i.e.&nbsp;the LocationID factor), but also the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D">, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BA10%7D-L_%7BA90%7D">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BCeq%7D-L_%7BAeq%7D"> features whose effects vary across locations. These slopes are given in Figure&nbsp;4. This point highlights the need to consider how the context of a location will influence the relationship between the acoustic features and the perceived pleasantness.</p>

<p>Through the group-level feature selection, all of the group-level coefficients were removed, including the LocationID factor itself. Therefore the final ISOEventful model is a ‘flat’ multi-variate linear regression model, rather than a multi-level model. The ISOEventful model is a linear combination of S, FS, T, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D">, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BCeq%7D-L_%7BAeq%7D">.

<p>Once the two models were built and assessed, they were then applied to the lockdown recording data in order to predict the new soundscape ISO coordinates. Figure&nbsp;5 (a) shows the pre-lockdown ISO coordinates for each location and Figure&nbsp;5 (b) shows how the soundscapes are predicted to have been assessed during the lockdown period. As in the model assessment process, the predicted responses are calculated for each recording individually, then the mean for each location is calculated and plotted on the circumplex.</p>
<p>In 2019 the majority of locations in the dataset fall within the ‘vibrant’ quadrant of the circumplex, particularly those which are primarily dominated by human activity (e.g.&nbsp;San Marco, Tate Modern). Camden Town and Euston Tap, which are both in general visually and acoustically dominated by traffic, are the only two to be rated as ‘chaotic’, while no locations are overall considered to be ‘monotonous’. During the 2020 lockdown, there is general positive move along the ‘pleasant’ dimension and general negative move along the ‘eventful’ dimension, but several different patterns of movement can be noted. These are investigated further in the Discussion section below.</p>

<p>To interpret the results addressing the RQ1 and RQ2, it is necessary to separately look into the overall change in sound source composition, and the change in the affective quality of soundscapes per location.</p>
<section id="change-in-the-sound-source-composition" class="level4" data-number="4.1.1">
<h4 data-number="4.1.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="change-in-the-sound-source-composition"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Change in the sound source composition</h4>
<p>The open-ended question about sound sources in the online survey did not reveal a change in sound source types but rather confirmed that all types were still present in both conditions. The sound source composition question taken from the Method A of the <span class="citation" data-cites="ISO12913Part2">ISO/TS 12913-2:2018 (2018)</span> revealed a statistically significant reduction in human sound sources and a significant increase in the perceived dominance of natural sound sources.</p>
<p>The most frequent sound sources detected from the open-ended question correspond to the main four sound source types investigated, which indicated that all types remained present in the lockdown condition (at all the locations). While traffic intensity might have gone down, where the results of the Mann-Whitney U-test were inconclusive, but supported by the psychoacoustic measurements <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2020Assessing">(Aletta et al. 2020)</span>, traffic-related sound sources were still clearly present.</p>
<p>The sound source composition of an outdoor acoustic environment is extremely complex. Removing one component, such as human sounds, has implications on the whole <span class="citation" data-cites="Gordo2021Rapid">(Gordo et al. 2021)</span>. Testing the effects of this in situ is not straightforward and interpreting this study in line with ‘what is the impact of human sounds’ must be taken within the broader context of the range of conditions which changed within the acoustic environment. However, looking at the overarching picture, the lockdown condition was a useful and unique case study to understand the impact which human activities – and the human sound source type in particular – can have on soundscape perception of urban open spaces.</p>

<p>In order to interpret how the change of the acoustic environment at the locations examined would have been perceived, and to answer RQ2, relative change vectors within the circumplex space are shown in Figure . This clearly shows a few different patterns of soundscape change due to the effects of the 2020 lockdown. These can be further looked into depending on the magnitude and direction of change, shifts between quadrants shown in Figure&nbsp;5, and the sound source composition. The discussion below is organized according to groups of locations which show similar behaviors in the predicted magnitude and direction of change, or discusses a single location which is particularly notable.</p>
<section id="piazza-san-marco" class="level5" data-number="4.1.2.1">
<h5 data-number="4.1.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="piazza-san-marco"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2.1</span> Piazza San Marco</h5>
<p>The largest change is seen in Piazza San Marco, with a predicted increase in pleasantness of 0.24 and a decrease in eventfulness of 0.44, enough to move the soundscape out of the ‘vibrant’ quadrant and into ‘calm’. This extreme change (relative to the rest of the locations) is exactly what would be expected given the unique context of the measurements taken in 2019 – the measurement campaign corresponded with Carnevale, a yearly festival which centers around the square. By contrast, due to the particularly strict measures imposed in Italy, during the lockdown measurement period, the square was almost entirely devoid of people. What is promising is that, without any of this contextual information about the presence or absence of people, our model is able to capture and reflect what may be considered a reasonable and expected direction and scale of change within the soundscape circumplex.</p>

<p>The next locations of interest are those which, in the 2019 survey data, were rated as being dominated by traffic noise: Euston Tap, Camden Town, Torrington Square, and Pancras Lock. These are the only locations (besides San Marco) which show a predicted increase in pleasantness. Of these traffic-dominated spaces, the two which were most heavily dominated by traffic noise (Camden Town and Euston Tap) showed the most increase in pleasantness, with Torrington Square having slightly less of an increase. Pancras Lock, which was also rated as having high levels of both Human and Natural sounds shows only a modest improvement in pleasantness.</p>

<section id="locations-showing-a-decrease-in-pleasantness" class="level5" data-number="4.1.2.3">
<h5 data-number="4.1.2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="locations-showing-a-decrease-in-pleasantness"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2.3</span> Locations showing a decrease in pleasantness</h5>
<p>Among the locations which are predicted to experience a negative effect on pleasantness we see a mix of spaces which were assessed as being dominated by Human (St Pauls Cross and Tate Modern) and Natural (Regents Park Japan, Regents Park Fields, Russell Square) sounds before the lockdown. It is hard to discern a pattern of difference between these two groups, although it appears that the Human-dominated spaces saw a greater reduction in eventfulness, compared to the Natural-dominated spaces.</p>
<p>In general, we note that most of the spaces experience some degree of reduction in eventfulness. This pattern is particularly consistent with what would be expected from a reduction in human presence in these spaces <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2018Towards">(Aletta and Kang 2018)</span>, as reflected by the observation that, in general, those spaces which had the most human sounds prior to the lockdown showed the greatest reduction in eventfulness during the lockdown. In particular, Tate Modern, Camden Town, and Torrington Square show the greatest reduction in eventfulness. This appears to be due to these locations showing the greatest reduction in overall <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D"> compared to other locations (8.1 dB, 5.2 dB, and 9.2 dB, respectively), with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D"> being the most influential feature in the eventfulness model, as shown in Table&nbsp;4. However, Russell Square also experienced a large decrease in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D"> on average (10.5 dB) but does not show the same reduction in eventfulness. This appears due to the correspondingly large decrease in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> (1.17 acum) which is not seen at the 3 previously mentioned locations. Russell Square normally features a medium-sized jet fountain which was turned off during the lockdowns in 2020 and therefore it experienced a drop in the overall sound level, but an increase in the proportion of low frequency noise to high frequency noise reflected by a decrease in sharpness which, within the eventfulness model, effectively cancels out the impact of the reduction in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D">. While the overall sound level has an important impact, in order to determine the true impact a reduction in sound level may have, it must be taken in context with how the other aspects of the sound will also change.</p>

<section id="euston-tap" class="level5" data-number="4.1.2.4">
<h5 data-number="4.1.2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="euston-tap"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2.4</span> Euston Tap</h5>
<p>An unexpected result is that Euston Tap is predicted to experience an increase in eventfulness and it is unclear whether this accurately reflects the real experience people would have had in the space. Normally, Euston Tap is a mostly-outdoor drinking venue located at the entrance to London Euston Station and situated directly along a very busy central London road. During the 2020 survey, the researchers noted that the music and chatter of people from the pub was noticeably missing, but that the perceived reduction in road traffic was minimal. Based on the theory of vibrancy which would suggest it is driven by human presence and sounds <span class="citation" data-cites="Aletta2018Towards">(Aletta and Kang 2018)</span>, we would not therefore expect a shift in the vibrant direction as indicated here. This discrepancy may reveal a weakness in the context-independent ISOEventful model, or it may in fact be indicating that, at certain thresholds of traffic noise, a reduction in level – and therefore a reduction in energetic masking – will allow other aspects of the sound to influence the perception.</p>
</section>
<section id="monumento-garibaldi" class="level5" data-number="4.1.2.5">
<h5 data-number="4.1.2.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="monumento-garibaldi"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2.5</span> Monumento Garibaldi</h5>
<p>Finally, special attention should be paid to the results shown for Monumento Garibaldi, which in 2019 was perceived as a pleasant and slightly calm green space featuring a gravel walkway. During the first measurement session during the lockdown in 2020, the researcher noted that the soundscape was dominated by landscaping works, in particular noise from strimmers (or weed whackers). In order to gain a sample which was more representative of the impact of the lockdowns, the researcher returned another day to repeat the measurements without interference from the works.</p>
<p>To examine the impact of these two scenarios separately, the prediction model was fitted to the data from the two sessions independently and the session which was impacted by the landscaping works is shown in Figure&nbsp;6 in gray and labeled MonumentoGaribaldi*, while the unaffected session is shown in red. In the latter case, the predicted change in soundscape as a result of the lockdown fits neatly into what would be expected and closely matches the predicted behavior of similar locations in London (i.e.&nbsp;Marchmont Garden and Russell Square). On the other hand, the session which was dominated by noise from the strimmers is predicted to have become much more chaotic, with a decrease in pleasantness of 0.16 and an increase in eventfulness of 0.27. This indicates that, although the model has no contextual information about the type of sound and in fact the training data never included sounds from similar equipment, just based on the psychoacoustic features of the sound it is able to reasonably predict the expected change in soundscape.</p>
</section>
<section id="general-notes" class="level5" data-number="4.1.2.6">
<h5 data-number="4.1.2.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-notes"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2.6</span> General notes</h5>
<p>As a whole, the primary impact of the 2020 lockdowns on the soundscapes in London and Venice was an overall decrease in eventfulness. With the exception of Euston Tap, all of the sessions show some degree of reduction in eventfulness, reflecting the general decrease in sound levels and human sound sources across the locations. The impact of the lockdowns on pleasantness is more mixed and seems to be driven by the previous dominance of traffic noise in the space. However, it could also be noted that, while all locations experienced a reduction in sound level, those which are predicted to become more pleasant had an average <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?L_%7BAeq%7D"> above 60 dB in 2019. By contrast, the locations which were predicted to experience a decrease in pleasantness generally had sound levels below 60 dBA in 2019. This may indicate that reductions in sound level can improve pleasantness when the sound level exceeds some threshold of around 60 - 65 dBA but are ineffective when sound levels are below this threshold. Similarly, <span class="citation" data-cites="Yang2005Acoustic">Yang and Kang (2005)</span> showed that, when the sound level is ‘lower than a certain value, say 70 dB’ there is no longer a significant improvement in the evaluation of acoustic comfort as the sound level reduces. It is unclear at this point where this threshold would lie for pleasantness/annoyance, how strict it may be, or how it is impacted by the sound source composition of the acoustic environment, therefore further research is needed in this area.</p>

<h4 data-number="4.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="model-selection-results"><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Model selection results</h4>
<p>The most immediately interesting result of the model-building and feature selection process, answering to RQ3, is the apparent irrelevance of location context to the ISOEventful dimension. The multilevel model structure was chosen since the starting assumption was that soundscape perception is heavily influenced by contextual factors, such as expectations of the space and visual context <span class="citation" data-cites="Ricciardi2015Sound">(Ricciardi et al. 2015)</span>. For this modeling, these factors can be considered as location-level latent variables at least partially accounted for by the inclusion of the LocationID as the second-level factor. While this assumption certainly held true for ISOPleasant, our results indicate that these types of contextual factors are not significant for ISOEventful, and do not affect the relationship between the acoustic features of the sound and the perception.</p>
<p>In particular this result may herald a shift in modeling approach for soundscapes – where previous methods, in both the soundscape and noise paradigms, have mostly focused on deriving acoustic models of annoyance (in other words have focused on the ISOPleasant dimension) perhaps they should instead consider the acoustic models as primarily describing the eventfulness dimension when considered in situ. In addition this study takes the approach of modeling responses at an individual level in order to derive the soundscape assessment of the location. Rather than either attempting to represent the predicted response of an individual person – which is less useful in this sort of practical application – or to base the model on average metrics of the location, the goal is instead to characterize the location itself, through the aggregated predicted responses of individuals. The authors believe this modeling approach better addresses the practical goal of predictive soundscape modeling and reflects the structure of the data collection.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-of-the-study"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Limitations of the study</h3>
<p>The onsite sampling method was initially not intended as the ultimate characterization of a location’s soundscape but rather as a tool for model development. Therefore, the change observed does not necessarily represent the ground truth about the site’s soundscape, if such a thing exists. Further, the online listening tests took a relatively small but random sample from the available database and did not include any contextual information. This proved to be sufficient for the purpose of detecting a change in sound source composition, however the relatively small sample of recordings included in the online study does limit how representative they are of the location’s sound environment as a whole. Similarly, the surveys and recordings taken represent only a snapshot of the soundscape or sound environment for a short period in time. This is a flaw in most soundscape sampling methods presented both in the literature and in ISO/TS 12913-2. To truly be said to characterize the soundscape of a space, long-term monitoring and survey methods will need to be developed in order to capture the changing environmental and contextual conditions in the space. Models of the sort presented here, which are based on measurable quantities, could prove to be useful in this sort of longterm monitoring as they could take continuous inputs from sensors and generate the likely soundscape assessment over time.</p>
<p>The audio-visual interaction forms a key component in people’s perception of urban spaces. This consideration has been a strength of soundscape research and has been incorporated via the use of in situ data collection. However, the visual aspect, and in particular how the visual environment changed as a result of the lockdown condition, was not considered in this study, reducing the comprehensiveness of the model. This was due primarily to data collection limitations imposed by the lockdown restrictions which made it impractical to replicate the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?360%5E%7B%5Ccirc%7D"> videos made during the 2019 sessions. Future work on comprehensive predictive soundscape models should strive to make use of this visual aspect within their considered features.</p>
<p>The limitation of the sound source categorization adopted from the ISO standard is that it may not be clear to a respondent in which category they would place community sounds like church bells and music. This may be particularly relevant for comparing the lockdown condition, as in particular the ringing of bells for worship varied in different contexts throughout the pandemic. Whether bells ceased entirely or were increased not only would have an impact on the sound environment, but the purposeful action behind the decision to ring bells may have changed to public’s relationship to and perception of the sound itself <span class="citation" data-cites="Parker2020Anthropause">(Parker and Spennemann 2020)</span>. The open ended question on sound sources, however, revealed the presence of church bells in both years. Unfortunately, this is a limitation of the sound source categories given by the ISO standard on which this questionnaire was based. A sensible update based on the findings and experiences reported here would be to combine the Traffic and Other Noise categories as separating them does not appear to provide additional information, and to include a new category which would in some way encapsulate the types of community sounds for which there is currently not a clear category.</p>
<p>Further, the lockdown condition is likely to cause distortions of the circumplex soundscape perception model. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that all the predictions were made for the people with no experience of the pandemic and its psychological effects. Conceptually, this model captured the perceptual mapping (i.e.&nbsp;the relationship between the acoustic indicator inputs and the soundscape descriptor outputs) of people in 2019, but this perceptual mapping is likely to have been affected by the psychological and contextual impacts of the lockdown itself, independent of its changes on the sound environment. Future research might look into potential perception changes in the post-pandemic world.</p>

<h2 data-number="5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>This study demonstrates an application of predictive modeling to the field of soundscape studies. The model building results reveal that, within this dataset, an approach based on psychoacoustics can achieve <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2%20=%200.85"> for predicting the pleasantness of locations and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R%5E2%20=%200.715"> for predicting the eventfulness. A modeling–focused method of this sort is a key component to the potential scalability of the soundscape approach to applications such as smart city sensing, urban planning, and cost-effective, sustainable design. To demonstrate the usefulness and feasibility of such an approach, we apply our predictive model to a unique case study in which traditional soundscape survey methods were impossible.</p>
<p>By applying this predictive model to recordings collected during the 2020 lockdown, the change in perception of the urban soundscapes is revealed. In general, soundscapes became less eventful, and those locations which were previously dominated by traffic noise became more pleasant. By contrast, previously human- and natural-dominated locations are in fact predicted to become less pleasant despite the decrease in sound levels. While all sound source categories remained present in both years, overall, in 2020 a decrease in human sounds’ dominance was observed together with an increase in the perceived dominance of natural sounds. Although these results are limited in that they represent one snapshot of the soundscape of the spaces, the success of the model in responding to new and disturbing sound events demonstrates its potential usefulness in long-term monitoring of urban soundscapes.</p>

  abstract = {The unprecedented lockdowns due to COVID-19 in spring 2020
    triggered changes in human activities in public spaces. A predictive
    modeling approach was developed to characterize the changes in the
    perception of the sound environment when people could not be
    surveyed. Building on a database of soundscape questionnaires
    (\$N=1,136\$) and binaural recordings (\$N=687\$) collected in 13
    locations across London and Venice during 2019, new recordings
    (\$N=571\$) were made in the same locations during the 2020
    lockdowns. Using these 30-second-long recordings, linear multi-level
    models were developed to predict soundscape pleasantness
    (\$R\^{}2=0.85\$) and eventfulness (\$R\^{}2=0.715\$) during the
    lockdown and compare changes for each location. Performance was
    above average for comparable models. An online listening study also
    investigated the change in sound sources within the spaces. Results
    indicate: 1) human sounds were less dominant and natural sounds more
    dominant across all locations; 2) contextual information is
    important for predicting pleasantness but not for eventfulness; 3)
    perception shifted towards less eventful soundscapes and to more
    pleasant soundscapes for previously traffic-dominated locations, but
    not for human- and natural-dominated locations. This study
    demonstrates the usefulness of predictive modeling and the
    importance of considering contextual information when discussing the
    impact of sound level reductions on the soundscape.}
