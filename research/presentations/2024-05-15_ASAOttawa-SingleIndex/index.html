<meta name="citation_title" content="Soundscape Perception Indices (SPI) - A unified framework for defining context-dependent single value indices">
<meta name="citation_abstract" content="The soundscape approach provides a basis for considering the holistic perception of sound environments, in context. While steady advancements have been made in methods for assessment and analysis, a gap exists for comparing soundscapes and quantifying improvements in the multi-dimensional perception of a soundscape. To this end, there is a need for the creation of single value indices to compare soundscape quality which incorporate context, aural diversity, and specific design goals. Just as a variety of decibel-based indices have been developed for various purposes (e.g., LAeq, LCeq, L90, Lden, etc.), the soundscape approach requires the ability to create novel indices for different uses, but which share a common language and understanding. We therefore propose a unified framework for creating both bespoke and archetypal single index measures of soundscape perception based on the soundscape circumplex model, allowing for new indices to be defined in the future. The implementation of this framework is demonstrated through the creation of a public space typology-based index using survey data collected under the SSID Protocol. Indices developed under this framework can enable a broader and more efficient application of the soundscape approach in design, planning, and regulation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An integrated framework on soundscape perception and spatial experience by adapting post-occupancy evaluation methodology;,citation_abstract=The effecting factors of soundscape perception and space experience have a very close relationship. This study aims to synthesize the diversity of soundscape classifications and schemes and unify such factorial variations in order to develop an integrated framework for soundscape perception and spatial experience within a systematic review of recent progress and by adapting post-occupancy evaluation methodology. First, factors under soundscape perception and space experience are reviewed in detail and merged to form conceptual classification models. Six soundscape perception factors are formed as (1) sonic, (2) spatial, (3) temporal, (4) psychological, (5) behavioural and (6) personal. Similarly, five space experience factors are formed as (1) user, (2) usage, (3) architectural design, (4) social context and (5) physical environment. All related items in the literature are presented and the sub-items under each factor are exemplified. Second, factors under the merged conceptual models are integrated by considering occupants’ experience of space regarding their variance in perception of soundscapes through acoustical post-occupancy evaluation. An adapted study design is proposed under indicative, investigative and diagnostic stages of the post-occupancy evaluation by presenting the methods, data types and factorial correlations for each stage.;,citation_author=Ayad A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A grounded theory approach to investigate the perceived soundscape of open-plan offices;,citation_abstract=This paper presents the findings of a user focused soundscape survey, that took place in a visual task based and a computational task based open-plan office spaces. Aim of this study was to conduct a grounded theory survey which captures individuals’ subjective response to the soundscape and creating a conceptual framework in the end. In order to achieve this goal, acoustical environment and sound sources were identified. In-situ measurements of sound levels (LAeq) and simulations, prepared by Odeon Room Acoustics Software 13.10 Combined, were used to explore the acoustical environment of the office spaces. Grounded Theory was used as the main research method to create a conceptual soundscape framework, and to reveal employees perception of the soundscape of their work environment. As part of grounded theory, semi-structured interviews were conducted with forty-nine employees from both types of offices. The results showed how the task at hand were affected by the sound environment and employees’ characteristics. Sound that were not expected or out of context and those that interfere with the concentration demanding tasks caused a negative interpretation of the soundscape. Due to this, employees’ adopted coping methods such as, accepting and habituating, intervening to the sound source, or putting on headphones to isolate themselves from the soundscape. It was discovered during the interviews that employees were concerned with silence as much as they were concerned with the noise. Employees expressed that the sound of keyboard and mouse means that they are working at that moment, there are other people around, and they are not working alone, or not working overtime.;,citation_author=Volkan Acun;,citation_author=Semiha Yilmazer;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=January 2017;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2017.09.018;,citation_issn=1872-910X;,citation_volume=131;,citation_journal_title=Applied Acoustics;,citation_publisher=Elsevier;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundscape approach integrating noise mapping techniques: a case study in Brighton, UK;,citation_abstract=In the guidelines about the management of areas of good environmental noise quality recently published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) it is suggested to combine different methodologies, like noise mapping, sound level measurements and the soundscape approach. Such a recommendation has started to be recognised by a number of local authorities in Europe that are gradually integrating a holistic concept into their environmental noise policies. This research aimed to explore and demonstrate the possibility to integrate conventional noise mapping methods and soundscape methods in an actual urban redevelopment project. A case study was made using the Valley Gardens project in Brighton &amp;amp;amp; Hove (UK). Different scenarios of sound-pressure level distributions were simulated for both traffic sound sources (i.e. noise maps) and natural sound sources (i.e. sound maps). Additionally, individual responses about the sound environment of the place collected during an on-site question survey were used to implement soundscape maps.;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_publication_date=2015-07;,citation_cover_date=2015-07;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/noise.2015.2.issue-1/noise-2015-0001/noise-2015-0001.xml http://files/427/Aletta and Kang - 2015 - Soundscape approach integrating noise mapping tech.pdf;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1515/noise-2015-0001;,citation_issn=2084-879X;,citation_volume=2;,citation_journal_title=Noise Mapping;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundscape descriptors and a conceptual framework for developing predictive soundscape models;,citation_abstract=Soundscape exists through human perception of the acoustic environment. This paper investigates how soundscape currently is assessed and measured. It reviews and analyzes the main soundscape descriptors in the soundscape literature, and provides a conceptual framework for developing predictive models in soundscape studies. A predictive soundscape model provides a means of predicting the value of a soundscape descriptor, and the blueprint for how to design soundscape. It is the key for implementing the soundscape approach in urban planning and design. The challenge is to select the appropriate soundscape descriptor and to identify its predictors. The majority of available soundscape descriptors are converging towards a 2-dimensional soundscape model of perceived affective quality (e.g., Pleasantness-Eventfulness, or Calmness-Vibrancy). A third potential dimension is the appropriateness of a soundscape to a place. This dimensions provides complementary information beyond the perceived affective quality. However, it depends largely on context, and because a soundscape may be appropriate to a place although it is poor, this descriptor must probably not be used on its own. With regards to predictors, or soundscape indicators, perceived properties of the acoustic environment (e.g., perceived sound sources) are winning over established acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics. To move this area forward it is necessary that the international soundscape community comes together and agrees on relevant soundscape descriptors. This includes to agree on numerical scales and assessment procedures, as well as to standardize them.;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_author=undefined Axelsson;,citation_publication_date=2016-07;,citation_cover_date=2016-07;,citation_year=2016;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.02.001;,citation_volume=149;,citation_journal_title=Landscape and Urban Planning;,citation_publisher=Elsevier B.V.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Awareness of ’sound’ in nursing homes: A large-scale soundscape survey in Flanders (Belgium);,citation_abstract= 2017,  The Author(s) 2017. There are relatively few studies on the acoustic environment of care facilities. However, sound is an important component of the users’ experience and quality of life in these spaces, and particularly in nursing homes, where both staff and residents have medium- to long-term perspectives, contrarily to hospital settings. This study included an online large-scale survey for nursing homes in Flanders and it targeted the group of professionals. It aimed at providing an overview about noise sensitivity and sound perception of the staff members in their work environment, as well as investigating the potential effects on sound perception of staff role and context. Results showed that limited differences emerged for staff roles, while more differences were found when exploring the context factor.

This brief commentary paper aims at offering some insights into the new directions this research (and practice) field will likely go, in the near future. For this purpose, eleven early-career soundscape researchers and practitioners were approached and asked to provide a response to the question “What are the current priorities and challenges for soundscape research?” Five recurring themes were identified in the participants’ statements. A major concern of the interviewed sample is the need to bridge the academic and practice sides of the soundscape community, in order to better position this discipline in the broader framework of (urban) sound planning and design.;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Jieling Xiao;,citation_publication_date=2018-03;,citation_cover_date=2018-03;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.3390/challe9010016;,citation_issn=2078-1547;,citation_volume=9;,citation_journal_title=Challenges;,citation_publisher=MDPI AG;">

Yet, more empirical evidence is needed about the benefits of experiencing positive soundscapes for health, well-being and quality of life. In this study, a pilot questionnaire was distributed to 50 users of a public open space in London (Granary Square), which consisted of a standardized protocol for collecting soundscape data (ISO 12913-2:2018, Method A), the World Health Organisation-Five Well-Being questionnaire (WHO-5) and a short protocol to assess perceived safety. Results show that associations between negative soundscape dimensions and lower well-being scores exist at a statistically significant level (p &amp;amp;amp;lt; .05) and other further insights into the relationships between sound perception and perceived safety. By making a stronger case for policy makers and planners, these findings contribute to the discourse of approaching the management of the urban acoustic environments in a proactive rather than reactive way, to promote healthy and supportive urban spaces.;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Arianna Astolfi;,citation_author=Sonja Di Blasio;,citation_author=Louena Shtrepi;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_author=Luca Molinero;,citation_publication_date=2019-09;,citation_cover_date=2019-09;,citation_year=2019;,citation_conference_title=23rd international congress on acoustics;">

The document provides an informative annex with three alternative methods: two are based on soundwalks and questionnaires, whilst the third refers to narrative interviews. This study was conducted in accordance with the ISO/TS 12913-2 technical specifications. Its aim was testing whether compatible results could be obtained from the first two methods, during the same data collection session. For this purpose, a soundwalk was organised in a university campus with two groups of students using the two methods separately, while experiencing the same acoustic environments. Results show that for this case study the two methods returned soundscape categorisations that are similar and have strong statistically significant associations (p = .023). In particular, in 7 out of 8 locations, the two methods would categorise positive and negative soundscapes identically. However, since the correspondence was not perfect, further studies should investigate the topic of methodological comparisons in soundscape research, and possibly consider revising or integrating the two methods.;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Claudia Guattari;,citation_author=Luca Evangelisti;,citation_author=Francesco Asdrubali;,citation_author=Tin Oberman;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2019.05.024;,citation_issn=1872-910X;,citation_journal_title=Applied Acoustics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assessing the changing urban sound environment during the COVID-19 lockdown period using short-term acoustic measurements;,citation_abstract=The implementation of lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in wide-ranging social and environmental implications. Among the environmental impacts is a decrease in urban noise levels which has so far been observed at the city scale via noise mapping efforts conducted through the framework of the Environmental Noise Directive. This study aims to understand how lockdown measures have manifested at a local level to better determine how the person-level experience of the urban soundscape has been affected and how these affects differ across urban space typologies. Taking London as a case study, a series of 30-second binaural recordings were taken at 11 locations representing a cross-section of urban public spaces with varying compositions of sound sources during Spring 2019 (pre-lockdown, N = 620) and Spring 2020 (during-lockdown, N = 481). Five acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics (LAeq, LA10, LA90, Loudness, Sharpness) were calculated for each recording and their changes from the pre-lockdown scenario to the lockdown scenario are investigated. Clustering analysis was performed which grouped the locations into 3 types of urban settings based on their acoustic characteristics.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundscape experience of public spaces in different world regions: A comparison between the European and Chinese contexts via a large-scale on-site surveya);,citation_abstract=The influence of cultural background on the soundscape experience in public spaces has been widely acknowledged. However, most studies have not used standardized protocols for soundscape perception data collection, nor have they gathered large datasets across different regions of the world to investigate possible cultural differences. This study explored the relationships between soundscape descriptors, perceived dominance of sound sources, and overall soundscape qualities and whether these relationships differ across world regions. A database of over 2000 soundscape surveys was collected in situ in outdoor public spaces in Europe and China. Results highlighted differences in how European and Chinese participants perceived the pleasantness and dominance of different sound sources. Specifically, the positive correlation between perceived pleasantness and natural sounds was stronger for European participants. For Chinese participants, vibrant soundscapes were positively correlated with perceived dominance of natural sounds, whereas in Europe, they were associated more with human-generated sounds. Perceived loudness had a greater effect on the appropriateness dimension for the Chinese sample than that for the European sample. This study provides a deeper understanding of how the geographical/cultural context can influence soundscape perception in public spaces and suggests that such country-specific factors should be considered when designing urban soundscapes.;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Tin Oberman;,citation_author=Andrew Mitchell;,citation_author=Mercede Erfanian;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_publication_date=2023-09;,citation_cover_date=2023-09;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1121/10.0020842;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_volume=154;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Review of Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks for Environmental Noise Monitoring in Smart Cities;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nowadays, more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas. Since this proportion is expected to keep rising, the sustainable development of cities is of paramount importance to guarantee the quality of life of their inhabitants. Environmental noise is one of the main concerns that has to be addressed, due to its negative impact on the health of people. Different national and international noise directives and legislations have been defined during the past decades, which local authorities must comply with involving noise mapping, action plans, policing, and public awareness, among others. To this aim, a recent change in the paradigm for environmental noise monitoring has been driven by the rise of Internet of Things technology within smart cities through the design and development of wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs). This work reviews the most relevant WASN-based approaches developed to date focused on environmental noise monitoring. The proposals have moved from networks composed of high-accuracy commercial devices to the those integrated by ad hoc low-cost acoustic sensors, sometimes designed as hybrid networks with low and high computational capacity nodes. After describing the main characteristics of recent WASN-based projects, the paper also discusses several open challenges, such as the development of acoustic signal processing techniques to identify noise events, to allow the reliable and pervasive deployment of WASNs in urban areas together with some potential future applications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;;,citation_author=Francesc Alías;,citation_author=Rosa Ma.

The PTS case in Granada (Spain);,citation_abstract=The assessment and management of environmental noise in Granada has been done, according to law, through the elaboration of Strategic Noise Maps (SNM) and Noise Action Plans (NAP). This approach does not include how the urban ambient quality is perceived and understood by citizens, a question studied in Granada by means of Local Agenda 21 actions, especially those on noise annoyance evaluation. After 2016 SNM results, in the preparation of the new NAP, the city came across a great acoustic challenge in a new area located outskirts characterised by a growing urbanisation, still under development, the greatest legal protection because of sensitive teaching and hospital buildings and, at the same time, the greatest noise exposure from the ringway supporting heavy traffic flows. Finding the best actions for noise control exclusively under the traditional technical approach appeared as a rather complicated task, resulting in the soundscape approach assumed for the first time in Granada. As quiet urban areas are not characterised by the absence of noise but for the presence of the right noise, this research intends to provide the local administration with results and proposals to help transform this conflict area in a pleasant or quiet urban area.;,citation_author=José Antonio Almagro Pastor;,citation_author=Jerónimo Vida Manzano;,citation_author=Rafael García Quesada;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_isbn=9788487985317;,citation_conference_title=INTER-NOISE 2019 MADRID - 48th international congress and exhibition on noise control engineering;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Noise Events Monitoring for Urban and Mobility Planning in Andorra la Vella and Escaldes-Engordany;,citation_abstract=Noise pollution is a critical factor and it has an important impact on public health, with the relationship between road traffic noise (RTN) and several illnesses in urban areas of particular concern. Andorra is currently developing a national strategy regarding noise pollution in their urban environments. The Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Sustainability is trying to to identify, monitor, map and model the effects of noise pollution and design mitigation policies to reduce the impact in certain priority areas. This analysis should take into account the existence of different types of anomalous noise events (ANEs) present in the street, e.g., horns, people talking, music, and other events that coexist with RTN, to characterize the soundscape of each of the locations. This paper presents a preliminary analysis considering both the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the duration of the ANEs to evaluate their presence in urban areas in the three different locations in Andorra la Vella and Escaldes-Engordany. The experiments conducted required a 10-h recording campaign distributed in the three locations under study, which was evaluated on two different days, one during the week and the other on the weekend.

In order to monitor critical locations, Wireless Acoustic Sensor Networks are being deployed, mainly in European and American cities. These networks focus primarily on measuring noise levels associated with road traffic. However, a number of different sounds are also present in urban areas and if our overall aim is to improve the quality of life of city inhabitants, then these additional sounds should be considered in accordance with the soundscape approach. This think piece proposes a step forward in the analysis of citizens’ perception of noise annoyance. We want to analyse the degree of annoyance caused by different sounds and study how this is related to psychoacoustic parameters. To this end, we propose to assess the acoustic environment by conducting perceptual tests on data gathered in a noise monitoring network.

These strategic noise maps are usually derived from traffic counts and propagation models because large-scale measurement of the acoustic environment using conventional methods is in feasible. In this study, the authors surveyed the entire city of Southampton, UK using a mobile survey technique, capturing spatial variations in street-level sound characteristics across multiple frequencies from all sound sources. Over 52,000 calibrated and georeferenced sound clips covering 11 Hz to 22.7 kHz are analysed here to investigate variations in sound frequency composition across urban space and the applied to two issues: the definition of naturalness in the acoustic environment; and perceptions of social inequity in sound exposure. Clusters of acoustic characteristics were identified and mapped using spectral clustering and principal components analysis based on octave bands, ecoacoustic indices and dBA. We found independent patters in low, mid and high frequencies, and the ecoacoustic indices that related to land use. Ecoacoustic indices partially mapped onto green space, identifying naturalness, but not uniquely, probably because urban anthropropogenic sounds occur at higher frequencies than in the natural areas where such indices were developed. There was some evidence of inequity in sound exposure according to social deprivation and ethnicity, and results differed according to frequency bands.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Towards the integration of urban sound planning in urban development processes: the study of four test sites within the SONORUS project;,citation_abstract=Noise pollution in urban environments is today a major problem affecting inhabitants of many European cities. Reducing noise is therefore a necessity. As a result, many cities now have noise action plans comprising concrete actions to tackle noise issues in affected areas. Nevertheless, these often isolated documents only address existing problems. In order to change this practice an integrated strategy is necessary. A new approach to urban sound planning, a holistic approach, is being developed and tested within the SONORUS project and it is described in this paper. SONORUS, the Urban Sound Planner project, is an initial training network (ITN) that is educating researchers in a whole range of acoustic disciplines, as well as in advanced urban planning processes. An essential part of this training is the application of the holistic approach to real test sites. Although this is an ongoing work, a few innovative techniques were already developed and its application to the test sites resulted in improved urban sound planning tools. This paper promotes the discussion about the implications that the holistic approach might have in urban sound planning policies and how it can be a driving force for changing the noise pollution situation in urban environments.;,citation_author=Sonia Alves;,citation_author=Laura Estévez-Mauriz;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Gemma M.

Noise is not just a nuisance to city dwellers as it negative implications go far beyond the issue of quality-of-life; it contributes to cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbance, and tinnitus, while also interfering with learning activities. One of the greatest issues in measuring noise lies in two of the core characteristics of acoustic noise itself - transiency and structural multidimensionality. Common noise measurement practices based on average noise levels are severely inadequate in capturing the essence of noise and sound characteristics in general. Noise changes throughout the day, throughout the week, throughout the month, throughout the year, and chages with respect to its frequency characteristics, energy levels, and the context in which it is heard.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Energy audit of schools by means of cluster analysis;,citation_abstract=More than 30 % of the Italian schools have very low energy efficiency due to aging or poor quality of construction. The current European policy on energy saving, with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 244/2012, recommends a cost-optimal analysis of retrofit improvements, starting from some reference buildings. One relevant issue is the definition of a set of reference buildings effectively representative of the considered stock. A possible solution could be found using data mining techniques, such as the K-means clustering method, which allows the division of a large sample into more homogeneous and small groups. This work adopts the cluster analysis to find out a few school buildings representative of a sample of about 60 schools in the province of Treviso, North-East of Italy, thus reducing the number of buildings to be analyzed in detail to optimize the energy retrofit measures. Real consumption data of the scholastic year 2011-2012 were correlated to buildings characteristics through regression and the parameters with the highest correlation with energy consumption levels used in cluster analysis to group schools. This method has supported the definition of representative architectural types and the identification of a small number of parameters determinant to assess the energy consumption for air heating and hot water production.;,citation_author=Rigoberto Arambula Lara;,citation_author=Giovanni Pernigotto;,citation_author=Francesca Cappelletti;,citation_author=Piercarlo Romagnoni;,citation_author=Andrea Gasparella;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2015.03.036;,citation_issn=0378-7788;,citation_pmid=23858085;,citation_volume=95;">

The absence of vehicles and people on the streets has led to a noise reduction captured by the monitoring network of the City of Madrid. In this article, an analysis has been carried out to describe the reduction in noise pollution that has occurred and to analyze the changes in the temporal patterns of noise, which are strongly correlated with the adaptation of the population’s activity and behavior to the new circumstances. The reduction in the sound level ranged from 4 to 6 dBA for the indicators Ld, Le, and Ln, and this is connected to a significant variation in the daily time patterns, especially during weekends, when the activity started earlier in the morning and lasted longer at midday, decreasing significantly in the afternoon.;,citation_author=César Asensio;,citation_author=Ignacio Pavón;,citation_author=Guillermo Arcas;,citation_publication_date=2020-09;,citation_cover_date=2020-09;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1121/10.0002008;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_volume=148;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;,citation_publisher=Acoustical Society of America ASA;">

This study reports on modeling pleasantness in urban context using perceptual assessments and sound measurements for specific locations during an urban walk. These assessments have been collected from four groups of approximately ten participants on 19 different assessment locations, along a 2.1 km-long path traveled in both directions. Simultaneously, 1/3-octave band sound levels and audio were recorded. Perceptual and physical models of pleasantness are proposed for specific locations based on multiple linear regressions. A multilevel analysis was performed, and it is shown that a perceptual model that includes perceived loudness joined to the perceived time of presence of traffic, voices and birds explains 90% of the pleasantness variance due to the sound environment variations. Physical models that include the original acoustic indicators that are most correlated with perceptual variables explain 85% of this variance. Thanks to these models, a unique averaged pleasantness value is defined for each assessment location from the perceptual or physical collected assessments. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the averaged perceived pleasantness and the modeled values from perceptual assessment reaches r(19) = 0.98, and r(19) = 0.97, with the modeled values from physical measurements. These results make it possible to consider the use of this kind of models in a cartographic context. As the path was traveled in both directions, the presentation-order effect has also been assessed, and it has been found that path direction did not have a significant impact on the pleasantness assessment at specific locations, except when very strong sound environment changes occurred. Finally, the study gives some insights about the retrospective global pleasantness assessment for urban walks. For very short walks between two assessment locations, a recency effect is shown. Nevertheless, this effect doesn’t seem to be significant when longer routes are assessed.;,citation_author=Pierre Aumond;,citation_author=Arnaud Can;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_author=Carlos Ribeiro;,citation_author=Catherine Lavandier;,citation_publication_date=2017-05;,citation_cover_date=2017-05;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.3813/aaa.919073;,citation_issn=1861-9959;,citation_volume=103;,citation_journal_title=Acta Acustica united with Acustica;">

Network-based sound monitoring systems are deployed in various cities over the world and mobile applications allowing participatory sensing are now common. Nevertheless, the sparseness of the collected measurements, either in space or in time, complicates the production of sound maps. This paper describes the results of a measurement campaign that has been conducted in order to test different spatial interpolation strategies for producing sound maps. Mobile measurements have been performed while walking multiple times in every street of the XIIIth district of Paris. By adaptively constructing a noise map on the basis of these measurements, the role of the density of observations and the performance of four different interpolation strategies is investigated. Ordinary and universal Kriging methods are assessed, as well as the effect of using an alternative definition of the distance between observation locations, which takes the topology of the road network into account. The results show that a high density of observation points is necessary to obtain an interpolated sound map close to the reference map.;,citation_author=Pierre Aumond;,citation_author=Arnaud Can;,citation_author=Vivien Mallet;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Carlos Ribeiro;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_author=Catherine Lavandier;,citation_publication_date=2018-07;,citation_cover_date=2018-07;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.5034799;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_volume=143;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=May information load be the key dimension underlying soundscape perception?;,citation_abstract=Whether to improve existing soundscapes or to design future soundscapes it is central to have a prediction model that can guide our actions in order to achieve desired outcomes. In order to create such a predication model it is necessary to understand the psychological processes that underlie soundscape perception. In the present paper I outline a theoretic framework for such psychological processes. I propose that Information Load is the most fundamental dimensions underlying soundscape perception and the cause of emotional responses to soundscapes. In this context information load is an interaction between soundscape complexity and our ability to comprehend or to process information. The framework predicts that low degree of information load (a monotonous soundscape) is boring, a moderate degree of information load (a quiet natural soundscape) is pleasant, above moderate degree of information load (an eventful soundscape) is exciting, and a very high degree of information load (a chaotic soundscape) is unpleasant. In addition, I propose promising indicators of information load, like 1/f-like noise, which may be used to test the proposed framework.;,citation_author=Östen Axelsson;,citation_publication_date=2009;,citation_cover_date=2009;,citation_year=2009;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870007769{\&amp;amp;amp;}origin=resultslist{\&amp;}sort=plf-f{\&amp;}src=s{\&amp;}st1=1{\%}2Ff+noise+AND+soundscape{\&amp;}st2={\&amp;}sid=af3bab22f277276093e7eb8a1a00cd17{\&amp;}sot=b{\&amp;}sdt=b{\&amp;}sl=39{\&amp;}s=TITLE-ABS-KEY{\%}281{\%}2Ff+noise+AND+soundscape{\%}29{\&amp;}relpos=2{\&amp;}citeCn;,citation_conference_title=38th international congress and exposition on noise control engineering 2009, INTER-NOISE 2009;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A principal components model of soundscape perception;,citation_abstract=There is a need for a model that identifies underlying dimensions of soundscape perception, and which may guide measurement and improvement of soundscape quality. With the purpose to develop such a model, a listening experiment was conducted. One hundred listeners measured 50 excerpts of binaural recordings of urban outdoor soundscapes on 116 attribute scales. The average attribute scale values were subjected to principal components analysis, resulting in three components: Pleasantness, eventfulness, and familiarity, explaining 50, 18 and 6% of the total variance, respectively. The principal-component scores were correlated with physical soundscape properties, including categories of dominant sounds and acoustic variables. Soundscape excerpts dominated by technological sounds were found to be unpleasant, whereas soundscape excerpts dominated by natural sounds were pleasant, and soundscape excerpts dominated by human sounds were eventful. These relationships remained after controlling for the overall soundscape loudness (Zwicker’s N(10)), which shows that ’informational’ properties are substantial contributors to the perception of soundscape. The proposed principal components model provides a framework for future soundscape research and practice. In particular, it suggests which basic dimensions are necessary to measure, how to measure them by a defined set of attribute scales, and how to promote high-quality soundscapes.;,citation_author=Östen Axelsson;,citation_author=Mats E.

The results showed that fragrance could affect the perception of traffic noise, which was reflected in increased overall comfort of the street, decreased annoyance caused by traffic noise, and improvement in auditory and olfactory satisfaction. The subjective evaluation of a street where double rows of lilac were planted was superior to that of single-row streets, and a decrease in traffic noise annoyance was more evident when the streets had lower traffic noise levels.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundscape quality in suburban green areas and city parks;,citation_abstract=According to guidelines proposed in Sweden, at least 80% of the visitors in quiet areas should perceive the sound environment as good. This was the starting point for a questionnaire study on &amp;amp;amp;quot;soundscape quality&amp;quot; in four suburban green areas and in four city parks. The soundscapes in the suburban areas were completely dominated by sounds from nature (e.g., bird song and sounds from water), whereas traffic noise was a main component of the city-park soundscapes. Measured equivalent sound levels (from all sources) ranged from 42 to 50 dBA in the suburban green areas, and from 49 to 60 dBA in the city parks (LAeq, 15min). &quot;Soundscape quality&quot; was assessed by a five-point bipolar category scale. Among the respondents, 84-100% in the suburban green areas and 53-65% in the city parks assessed the soundscape as &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Very good&quot;. Thus, all suburban green areas but none of the city parks reached the stipulated goal (at least 80%). The soundcape quality was confirmed by attribute profiling using a set of 12 adjectives. Based on the visitor’s responses, it is concluded that good soundscape quality can only be achieved if the traffic noise exposure in suburban green areas and city parks during day time is below 50 dBA.;,citation_author=Birgitta Berglund;,citation_author=Mats E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On a Tool for Measuring Soundscape Quality in Urban Residential Areas;,citation_abstract=An attribute-profiling tool, customized for 106 residents’ structured listening walks, was developed for measuring &amp;amp;amp;quot;soundscape quality&amp;quot; in 24 kinds of listening places representing four urban residential areas exposed to road-traffic noise. The tool’s 12 attributes were matched to the soundscape on a scale from 0 to 100%. The attributes were: soothing, pleasant, light, dull, eventful, exciting, stressful, hard, intrusive, annoying, noisy, and loud. In total, the soundscape quality of 636 unique 30-s soundscapes was measured. For food soundscape quality (pleasant and soothing) to predominate outdoors, the overall sound level of soundscapes had to be below ca. 50 dB LAeq,30s. Indoor soundscapes (closed windows) at exposed sides of buildings were found to be of inferior quality compared to outdoor soundscapes at shielded sides. This was true although the former soundscapes were 14 dB LAeq,30s lower than the latter. A PCA analysis of the 12-attribute profiles of the 24 kinds of listening places showed that residents actually perceived &quot;signatures&quot; of soundscape quality linked to the origin of soundscapes, whether indoor or outdoors. All soundscapes at shielded sides indoors with closed windows clustered together with the indoor and outdoor soundscapes in the low road-traffic noise exposed residential area. Conversely, at building sides with high traffic-noise exposure, all soundscapes, outdoors or indoors with open window, clustered together with their outdoor soundscapes at the shielded sides. The new attribute-profiling tool is promising because it measures soundscape quality beyond unwanted sounds and mere sound level of predominant noise.;,citation_author=Birgitta Berglund;,citation_author=Mats E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What is a salient object? A dataset and a baseline model for salient object detection;,citation_abstract=Salient object detection or salient region detection models, diverging from fixation prediction models, have traditionally been dealing with locating and segmenting the most salient object or region in a scene. While the notion of most salient object is sensible when multiple objects exist in a scene, current datasets for evaluation of saliency detection approaches often have scenes with only one single object. We introduce three main contributions in this paper: First, we take an indepth look at the problem of salient object detection by studying the relationship between where people look in scenes and what they choose as the most salient object when they are explicitly asked. Based on the agreement between fixations and saliency judgments, we then suggest that the most salient object is the one that attracts the highest fraction of fixations. Second, we provide two new less biased benchmark datasets containing scenes with multiple objects that challenge existing saliency models. Indeed, we observed a severe drop in performance of 8 state-of-the-art models on our datasets (40% to 70%). Third, we propose a very simple yet powerful model based on superpixels to be used as a baseline for model evaluation and comparison. While on par with the best models on MSRA-5K dataset, our model wins over other models on our data highlighting a serious drawback of existing models, which is convoluting the processes of locating the most salient object and its segmentation. We also provide a review and statistical analysis of some labeled scene datasets that can be used for evaluating salient object detection models. We believe that our work can greatly help remedy the over-fitting of models to existing biased datasets and opens new venues for future research in this fast-evolving field.;,citation_author=Ali Borji;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5027;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1109/TIP.2014.2383320;,citation_issn=1057-7149;,citation_volume=24;,citation_journal_title=IEEE Transactions on Image Processing;,citation_publisher=IEEE;">

Given the high prevalence of visual disabilities in this group, they supposedly depend more on sound to understand their surroundings. Nevertheless, there is little attention for (the effects of) sound in long-term healthcare. To address this issue, we conducted a small-scale intervention study among 13 healthcare professionals with Mobile Soundscape Appraisal and Recording Technology (MoSART: a smartphone application). Pre- and post-test measurements were administered of the emotional well-being (measured as moods and challenging behavior) of 15 clients with intellectual disabilities. Results showed that the MoSART intervention was accompanied by an increased experience of vibrant soundscapes and audibility of human sounds as perceived by the professionals, and a significant decrease of negative moods and severity of stereotypical behavior in the clients.

Research towards quantification of the acoustic descriptors of the urban soundscape is, however, still in an early stage. This paper draws on the analogy with music to propose an indicator for studying the temporal structure of the urban soundscape. The link to self-organized criticality of the underlying system is drawn. The influence on the new indicator of road traffic noise, an important soundscape disturber in urban areas, is analyzed in detail.  2005 Elsevier Ltd.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Measuring Noise for Health Impact Assessment;,citation_abstract=A good estimate of noise exposure of the population is needed to assess its health impacts. Measuring noise levels seems the most direct way to obtain exposure, but this contribution shows that this is not always as trivial as it might look. A first important issue is the selection of a suitable spectro-temporal integrated indicator. Secondly, the choice between personal exposure monitoring and environmental monitoring needs to be considered. This contribution also compares noise measurement to calculating noise exposure levels and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both angles of attack. Finally, the problem of relating the noise levels to the population is addressed. The latter boils down to finding out where people live based on limited geospatial information.;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-52272-6.00253-1;,citation_isbn=9780444522726;,citation_inbook_title=Encyclopedia of environmental health;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Early Stage Sound Planning in Urban Re-Development : The Antwerp Case Study;,citation_abstract=It has often been highlighted that sound planning should start at an early stage of development of an urban area. Nevertheless, no clear methodology has been outlined on how this should be realized in practice and what should be the role of an urban sound expert. We describe how urban sound experts played a role in early stage planning of the covering of the Antwerp ring road, a 109 Euro project, and deduct overall methodological guidelines. The involvement of urban sound experts has three main phases: (1) inform and educate; (2) co-create; (3) evaluate. During phase (1), scientific knowledge on urban soundscape design and sound propagation is translated to knowledge that applies to the local situation, a process involving simulation of prototype solutions. This knowledge can be used by the design teams in co-creation sessions, involving local citizens deriving views on the development of the area. In phase (2), urban sound experts become co-creators that, together with other members of the design team, modify and tweak solutions to meet the demands of citizens and vision of the planners. During the final phase, the urban sound experts evaluate the outcome of the design as part of a cost-benefit analysis.;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_author=Luc Dekoninck;,citation_author=Camille Meeussen;,citation_author=Timothy Van Renterghem;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_conference_title=INTER-NOISE 2017 - 47th international congress and exposition on noise control engineering: Impact of noise control engineering;">

The proposed method utilizes newly introduced integration functions that capture the texture window shape in combination with standard functions like mean and standard deviation in a classification scheme of 10 environmental sound classes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Urban noise surveys;,citation_abstract=Despite the large number of urban noise surveys which have been conducted to date, there are considerable weaknesses in the large body of data that such surveys have collected. For example, there are little data available which allow comparison of the acoustic environment of one city, or the noise exposure of its residents, with those of another. This is symptomatic of past approaches to urban noise surveys in which there has been misunderstanding of the nature of the urban acoustic environment to be measured and confusion resulting from multiple survey objectives. The major problem is that most survey results have been reported mainly as site-specific data. A review of 20 past survey procedures shows that the surveys can be categorized into four types: random sampling, sampling by land-use category, receptor-oriented sampling and source-oriented sampling. Various weaknesses in the different types are examined and it is suggested that several survey types and various survey objectives are incompatible. Receptor-oriented surveys would appear to offer the best opportunity for gathering noise level data which can be generalized from site-specific information to the exposure of a population. Disaggregation of noise by source type during a measurement programme could make the collection of noise data in urban noise surveys more efficient.;,citation_author=A. L. Brown;,citation_author=K.

The aim of this study is to research the sound masking effect by adding water sounds to the industrial noise. The electric welding noise, which was rated as most annoying in the pilot study, was used as the masked industrial noise. Rain, fountain and waterfall sounds were selected as masker and combined to welding noise with different sound level ratios. 37 participants were recruited to evaluate the stimuli in annoyance laboratory experiment. The masking effects were analyzed from the annoyance rate data. The study results showed that the masking effects of the water sounds to the welding noise were obvious and the fountain sound had the best effect. When the sound level of fountain sound was the same as the electric welding noise, the biggest annoyance reduction percentage was 29%.

The equations take into account the acoustic-streaming-driven convective heat transport; as time-averaged secondary-field quantities are directly calculated, the equations are much easier to integrate than the original fluid-dynamics equations. The model equations are implemented and integrated employing commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics. Numerical calculations are conducted for the case of a resonator with a wall-temperature gradient corresponding to the action of a thermoacoustic effect. It is shown that due to the convective heat transport, the streaming profile is considerably distorted even in the case of weak wall-temperature gradients.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Developing a taxonomy of soundscape design from real-world examples;,citation_abstract=Over the past 20 years, there has been a significant increase in soundscape studies focusing on urban scenarios. Policymakers are increasingly attracted to the concept of soundscapes, as reflected in several documents issued by international agencies that advocate a more user-centred approach when considering the urban acoustic environment. Despite widespread interest in the concept of soundscape, a consensus and systematic review of soundscape design and interventions, as well as a summary of empirical evidence on the benefits of sound methods, are still lacking. The catalogue of soundscape interventions (CSI) project aims to provide a tool for data collection and communication on soundscape practice, with the long-term goal of compiling frequent/recurring soundscape strategies into a “design toolkit” and developing a “design brief” to facilitate communication between local authorities and soundscape consultants and researchers. A platform for collecting examples of soundscape intervention has been published online, and the project is currently in its second phase of populating the example database. When sufficient practices have been gathered, a taxonomy of soundscape design will be developed, which will eventually become a “design toolkit.” To ensure that all perspectives are represented, and the taxonomy is based on consensus, stakeholders will be consulted. If a significant increase in the number of soundscape practices is detected, the taxonomy may require revision.;,citation_author=Xiaochao Chen;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Cleopatra Moshona;,citation_author=Helen Henze;,citation_author=Andrew Mitchell;,citation_author=Tin Oberman;,citation_author=Huan Tong;,citation_author=Andre Fiebig;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_author=Brigitte Schulte-Fortkamp;,citation_publication_date=2023-05-10;,citation_cover_date=2023-05-10;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.1121/10.0018743;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_volume=153;,citation_conference_title=184th meeting of the acoustical society of america;,citation_conference=Acoustical Society of America;">

Environmental sounds, such as chirpings of insects and sounds of rain which are typically noise-like with a broad flat spectrum, may include strong temporal domain signatures. However, only few temporal-domain features have been developed to characterize such diverse audio signals previously. Here, we perform an empirical feature analysis for audio environment characterization and propose to use the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm to obtain effective time-frequency features. The MP-based method utilizes a dictionary of atoms for feature selection, resulting in a flexible, intuitive and physically interpretable set of features. The MP-based feature is adopted to supplement the MFCC features to yield higher recognition accuracy for environmental sounds. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of these joint features for unstructured environmental sound classification, including listening tests to study human recognition capabilities. Our recognition system has shown to produce comparable performance as human listeners.;,citation_author=Selina Chu;,citation_author=Student Member;,citation_author=Shrikanth Narayanan;,citation_author=C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perception of auditory objects in complex scenes: Factors and applications;,citation_abstract= 2018 Institute of Acoustics. All rights reserved. Over the past twenty years, technological advances have driven the development of media consumption in both home and mobile contexts. While not ubiquitous, multi-channel audio home cinema systems have become more prevalent, as has the consumption of broadcast and gaming media on smartphone and tablet technology via mobile telecommunications networks. This has created new possibilities and poses new challenges for audio content delivery such as how the same content can be presented to greatest effect given that it may be consumed via either a surround-sound home entertainment system or in a mobile context using stereo headphones. This paper outlines research into the development of strategies to optimise audio delivery for broadcast, gaming and music content using audio-object theory informed by principles of Auditory Scene Analysis. The initial experiment in this project is a listening test that focuses on subject evaluation of audio objects isolated from context. This experiment will explore inherent inter-object hierarchies of importance using a foreground background evaluation task. An overview of the experiment will be offered with a summary of initial findings. We envisage further experiments to investigate how factors such as expectation may influence music scene analysis and how this knowledge might be used in object-based delivery scenarios.;,citation_author=W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Origins of 1 / f noise in human music performance from short-range autocorrelations related to rhythmic structures;,citation_abstract=1/f fluctuations have been described in numerous physical and biological processes. This noise structure describes an inverse relationship between the intensity and frequency of events in a time series (for example reflected in power spectra), and is believed to indicate long-range dependence, whereby events at one time point influence events many observations later. 1/f has been identified in rhythmic behaviors, such as music, and is typically attributed to long-range correlations. However short-range dependence in musical performance is a well-established finding and past research has suggested that 1/f can arise from multiple continuing short-range processes. We tested this possibilitiy using simulations and time-series modeling, complemented by traditional analyses using power spectra and detrended fluctuation analysis (as often adopted more recently). Our results show that 1/f-type fluctuations in musical contexts may be explained by short-range models involving multiple time lages, and the temporal ranges in which rythmic hierarchies are expressed are apt to create these fluctuations through such short-range autocorrelations. We also analzed gait, heartbeat, and resting-state EEG data, demonstrating the coexistence of multiple short-range processes and 1/f fluctuation in a variety of phenomena. This suggests that 1/f fluctuation might not indicate long-range correlations, and points to its likely origins in musical rhythm and related structures.;,citation_author=Ian D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Experience sampling: Assessing urban soundscapes using in-situ participatory methods;,citation_abstract=Think About Sound is a novel tool which shifts the traditional paradigm of environmental soundscape assessment using an experience sampling methodology. Over the last decade, smart phone ownership has increased immeasurably and this technology has been applied here in order to allow in situ soundscape assessment as participants go about their daily routine. Crowdsourcing data in this way has enormous potential to create rich and diverse data sets, where both qualitative and quantitative descriptions of environmental surroundings can be gathered in a flexible and non-invasive way. The application allows the collection and assessment of environmental soundscapes using the provided set of response questions and exploiting the native audio recording application on a GPS-enabled smart phone. This paper outlines the methodological approach used for the study and the technology employed by describing the submission procedure and the back-end processes involved in handling and collecting the data. Preliminary results from an experience sampling pilot study will also be presented and discussed as well as providing insight for future uses of such technology. The authors also propose future work with regards to the development of the application and the inclusion of crowdsourced data within an interactive online map.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perception of soundscapes: An interdisciplinary approach;,citation_abstract=This paper takes an overall view of findings from the Positive Soundscape Project, a large inter-disciplinary soundscapes study. Qualitative fieldwork (soundwalks and focus groups) have found that soundscape perception is influenced by cognitive effects such as the meaning of a soundscape and its components, and how information is conveyed by a soundscape, for example on the behaviour of people within the soundscape. Three significant clusters were found in the language people use to describe soundscapes: sound sources, sound descriptors and soundscape descriptors. Results from listening tests and soundwalks have been integrated to show that the two principal dimensions of soundscape emotional response seem to be calmness and vibrancy. Further, vibrancy seems to have two aspects: organisation of sounds and changes over time. The possible application of the results to soundscape assessment and design are briefly discussed.;,citation_author=William J. Davies;,citation_author=Mags D. Adams;,citation_author=Neil S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundscape reproduction and synthesis;,citation_abstract=The aims of this work were to investigate (i) whether soundscape perceptual dimensions are correctly reproduced by ambisonic loudspeaker playback, (ii) whether soundscape dimensional analysis is robust to changes of location and from the field to laboratory playback, and (iii) whether a simple soundscape synthesis can be used to interactively design a soundscape. The first two aims were addressed by an experiment which attempted to repeat the dimensional analysis made by Kang [1]. Kang used semantic differential scales to conduct an in-situ survey of two urban soundscapes in Sheffield, UK. He used factor analysis to derive four perceptual dimensions from the responses. The present work repeated this approach, but the fifteen participants were judging ambisonic recordings of four soundscapes in Manchester, UK. The present work found very similar dimensions to Kang but with more variance explained: relaxation/calmness (41%), dynamics/vibrancy (10%), communication (7%) and spatiality (7%). The dimensions from the two studies load onto the semantic scales in a similar way. These results indicate that an ambisonic reproduction of a soundscape gives similar results to field experiments, though with more variance explained. They also show that dimensional analysis of soundscape response is robust enough to produce similar results for different locations in different cities. To investigate the third aim, the ambisonic reproduction was extended to a system which allowed independent interactive control of sixteen foreground sounds set in an ambisonic background soundscape. Eight participants were able to use this system to successfully design a soundscape that expressed their intentions. It was found that the designed soundscapes seemed to be based more on participant expectation of typical urban soundscapes than on their preference for individual sounds. These results suggest that a more sophisticated soundscape synthesiser might be suitable for real design problems.  S. Hirzel Verlag EAA.;,citation_author=William J. Davies;,citation_author=Neil S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognition of soundscapes and other complex acoustic scenes;,citation_abstract=The fields of soundscapes, music cognition and audio quality have many similarities. Researchers in these areas are all dealing with perception and cognition of complex acoustic scenes. To date, there has been little cross-fertilisation between them. This paper examines some key concepts and results from soundscapes, music and audio. It is shown that perceptual dimensions, categories, and figure/ground play important roles in all three areas. The concept of the scale of the cognitive structure is introduced, building on results in music cognition. Scale refers to the way we can attend to the soundscape as a whole, or zoom in to a sound within it, or further in to a component or feature of that sound. It is suggested that scale links the models of perceptual dimensions, categories and auditory objects. The idea of scale is further used to suggest why the attention mechanism is so important in complex scenes, and why the concept of listening modes may be more simply explained as the consequences of attention. The paper concludes by speculating on the inherent cognitive apparatus applied to all complex scenes and suggests fruitful avenues for future research.;,citation_author=William J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relationship between the geometric profile of the city and the subjective perception of urban soundscapes;,citation_abstract=Large urban areas are very prone to be contaminated by different pollutants beyond safe limits. In recent years, it is not only pursued that these environments comply with all the regulations in this regard, but also to make them as comfortable as possible for their inhabitants. Being noise one of the most harmful pollutants, researchers and administrations are focusing their efforts in understanding and improving the subjective perception of the urban sound. This understanding could allow to make better decisions in the planning of large urban areas or in the efficient management of the traffic flow. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate if urban places with similar geometrical features are acoustically perceived in a similar manner. The study was conducted in the city centre of Madrid (Spain), where the sound was recorded in 13 places, and their geometrical features studied. In some of these places the recordings were performed more than one time, in different recording sessions, to study the acoustic stability of the environments. Psychoacoustic indicators were extracted and statistical analysis as well as clustering analysis were performed. A listening test was conducted to evaluate the agreement between the quantitative results and the perception of a sample of 16 participants. Both the quantitative and the qualitative analysis reported that urban places with similar geometries are perceived in a similar way. Also, it was proven that a recording performed a particular day in one place is highly representative of that place for similar working conditions. These results point out the benefits of incorporating the psychoacoustic indicators in the planning of large urban areas in order improve the acoustic comfort besides reducing the noise pollution.;,citation_author=Daniel De;,citation_author=Antonio Pedrero;,citation_author=María Ángeles;,citation_author=César Díaz;,citation_author=Daniel Prida;,citation_author=Antonio Pedrero;,citation_author=María Ángeles Navacerrada;,citation_author=César Díaz;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2019.01.025;,citation_issn=1872-910X;,citation_volume=149;,citation_journal_title=Applied Acoustics;,citation_publisher=Elsevier Ltd;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II;,citation_abstract=Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that use nondominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for their: 1) O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); 2) nonelitism approach; and 3) the need for specifying a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a nondominated sorting-based multiobjective EA (MOEA), called nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), which alleviates all the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast nondominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best (with respect to fitness and spread) N solutions. Simulation results on difficult test problems show that the proposed NSGA-II, in most problems, is able to find much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to Pareto-archived evolution strategy and strength-Pareto EA - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multiobjective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multiobjective optimizer and much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.;,citation_author=Kalyanmoy Deb;,citation_author=Amrit Pratap;,citation_author=Sameer Agarwal;,citation_author=T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A model for the perception of environmental sound based on notice-events;,citation_abstract=An approach is proposed to shed light on the mechanisms underlying human perception of environmental sound that intrudes in everyday living. Most research on exposure-effect relationships aims at relating overall effects to overall exposure indicators in an epidemiological fashion, without including available knowledge on the possible underlying mechanisms. Here, it is proposed to start from available knowledge on audition and perception to construct a computational framework for the effect of environmental sound on individuals. Obviously, at the individual level additional mechanisms (inter-sensory, attentional, cognitive, emotional) play a role in the perception of environmental sound. As a first step, current knowledge is made explicit by building a model mimicking some aspects of human auditory perception. This model is grounded in the hypothesis that long-term perception of environmental sound is determined primarily by short notice-events. The applicability of the notice-event model is illustrated by simulating a synthetic population exposed to typical Flemish environmental noise. From these simulation results, it is demonstrated that the notice-event model is able to mimic the differences between the annoyance caused by road traffic noise exposure and railway traffic noise exposure that are also observed empirically in other studies and thus could provide an explanation for these differences.;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_author=Tom De Muer;,citation_author=Birgitta Berglund;,citation_author=Mats E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A model of saliency-based auditory attention to environmental sound;,citation_abstract=A computational model of auditory attention to environmental sound, inspired by the structure of the human auditory system, is presented. The model simulates how listeners switch their attention over time between different auditory streams, based on bottom-up and top-down cues. The bottom-up cues are determined by the time-dependent saliency of each stream. The latter is calculated on the basis of an auditory saliency map, which encodes the intensity and the amount of spectral and temporal irregularities of the sound, and binary spectro-temporal masks for the different streams. The top-down cues are determined by the amount of volitional focusing on particular auditory streams. A competitive winner-takes-all mechanism, which balances bottom-up and top-down attention for each stream, determines which stream is selected for entry into the working memory. Consequently, the model is able to delimit the time periods during which particular streams are paid attention to. Although the main ideas could be applied to all types of sound, the implementation of the model was targeted at environmental sound in particular. As an illustration, the model is used to reproduce results from a detailed field experiment on the perception of transportation noise. Finally, it is shown how this model could be a valuable tool, complementing auralization, in the design of outdoor soundscapes.;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_publication_date=2010;,citation_cover_date=2010;,citation_year=2010;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/1180411/file/1180414.pdf;,citation_issue=August;,citation_isbn=9781617827457;,citation_journal_title=20th International Congress on Acoustics, ICA 2010;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Urban Soundscapes of the World: Selection and reproduction of urban acoustic environments with soundscape in mind;,citation_abstract=The advent of realistic yet affordable immersive audio-visual recording and reproduction systems that combine binaural or spatial audio with 360-degree video, backed by increasingly efficient and realistic acoustic simulation and auralization models, has led to an increased interest in the acoustic design of urban environments. Architects and designers are however well-known to work by example. One of the goals of the Urban Soundscapes of the World project is therefore to compile a comprehensive reference database of high quality immersive audio-visual recordings of urban sites, within a range of cities worldwide. The well-documented exemplars in this database can be used to serve as an ecologically valid baseline for assessing the perceptual influence of noise control and soundscaping measures through auralization. This paper reports on a perception-based protocol that was developed for the purpose of site selection, in particular for systematically identifying spots within a city with a specific soundscape. This protocol contains an online questionnaire that is conducted among panels of local experts, and that asks participants to pinpoint outdoor public spaces within the city that are perceived in specific ways, regarding the presence of sound sources, the core affect and emotion evoked, and the appropriateness of the sound environment. This approach was designed to lead to a range of urban sites with a wide variety of soundscapes, such that a good statistical power can be achieved in perception experiments that are conducted on the basis of the audio-visual recordings in the database.;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Kang Sun;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_publication_date=2017-08;,citation_cover_date=2017-08;,citation_year=2017;,citation_conference_title=INTER-NOISE 2017 - 46th international congress and exposition on noise control engineering: Taming noise and moving quiet;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundecology indicators applied to urban soundscapes;,citation_abstract=In remote ecological monitoring studies the characteristics of the soundscape is one of the key aspects in the assessment of the ecological environment. In order to characterize these natural soundscapes different acoustic indices are currently under study: the bioacoustic index, the acoustic complexity index, the acoustic diversity index, the acoustic eveness index and the normalized difference soundscape index. These indices reflect in part the nature of the different sounds present in the soundscape. As an example the acoustic complexity index is known to correlate with the number of bird vocalizations in the environment, while it is insensitive to airplane noise. In general, the indicators could reveal the balance between biophony, geophony, and anthrophony in the natural soundscape. Starting from urban sound recordings the different acoustic indices are calculated. In this way the resulting temporal character of the acoustic indices is obtained and can be related to the activity level in the biophony, geophony or anthrophony of the urban environment. The results show that soundecology concepts can be applied for soundscapes more strongly governed by noise.;,citation_author=Paul Devos;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the INTER-NOISE 2016 - 45th international congress and exposition on noise control engineering: Towards a quieter future;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Improvement of Zwicker’s psychoacoustic annoyance model aiming at tonal noises;,citation_abstract=According to 4 acoustical parameters of noise samples (i.e., loudness, sharpness, fluctuation strength and roughness), Zwicker’s psychoacoustic annoyance model can be used to estimate the relative degree of noise annoyance. However, this model cannot be well applied to compare the annoyance degrees of tonal noises and atonal noises. In order to improve its estimation effect on tonal noises, 3 groups of noise samples were selected randomly, i.e., 27 low-frequency tonal noise samples induced by a 1000 kV transformer with A-weighted equivalent sound pressure levels ranging from 41.2 dBA to 73.0 dBA; 30 low-, mid- or high-frequency tonal/atonal noise samples with loudness levels ranging from 60 phon to 80 phon; and 60 other noise samples with A-weighted equivalent sound pressure levels ranging from 40.7 dBA to 75.0 dBA. Laboratory listening tests were conducted on the above 3 sample groups respectively via an 11-point numerical scale. The Zwicker’s psychoacoustic annoyance model was improved by taking tonality into account, and introducing the evaluation result of the first noise sample group (1000 kV transformer noise samples) to determine the coefficients in the model. The applicability of the improved model was examined by the evaluation results of the other two groups as well as the data in a previous research on annoyance of 220 kV/500 kV transformer noises. Results show that the improved model can estimate the relative annoyance degrees caused by various types of tonal/atonal noises much more accurately.;,citation_author=Guo Qing Di;,citation_author=Xing Wang Chen;,citation_author=Kai Song;,citation_author=Bing Zhou;,citation_author=Chun Ming Pei;,citation_publication_date=2016-04;,citation_cover_date=2016-04;,citation_year=2016;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2015.12.006;,citation_issn=1872-910X;,citation_volume=105;,citation_journal_title=Applied Acoustics;,citation_publisher=Elsevier Ltd;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does Exposure to Noise Pollution Influence the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19?;,citation_abstract=Research that analyzes the effect of different environmental factors on the impact of COVID-19 focus primarily on meteorological variables such as humidity and temperature or on air pollution variables. However, noise pollution is also a relevant environmental factor that contributes to the worsening of chronic cardiovascular diseases and even diabetes. This study analyzes the role of short-term noise pollution levels on the incidence and severity of cases of COVID-19 in Madrid from February 1 to May 31, 2020. The following variables were used in the study: daily noise levels averaged over 14 days; daily incidence rates, average cumulative incidence over 14 days; hospital admissions, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and mortality due to COVID-19. We controlled for the effect of the pollutants PM10 and NO2 as well as for variables related to seasonality and autoregressive nature. GLM models with Poisson regressions were carried out using significant variable selection (p&amp;amp;amp;lt;0.05) to calculate attributable RR. The results of the modeling using a single variable show that the levels of noise (leq24h) were related to the incidence rate, the rate of hospital admissions, the ICU admissions and the rate of average cumulative incidence over 14 days. These associations presented lags, and the first association was with incidence (lag 7 and lag 10), then with hospital admissions (lag 17) and finally ICU admissions (lag 22). There was no association with deaths due to COVID-19. In the results of the models that included PM10, NO2, Leq24h and the control variables simultaneously, we observed that only Leq24h went on to become a part of the models using COVID-19 variables, including the 14-day average cumulative incidence. These results show that noise pollution is an important environmental variable that is relevant in relation to the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in the Province of Madrid.;,citation_author=Julio Díaz;,citation_author=José Antonio-López-Bueno;,citation_author=Dante Culqui;,citation_author=César Asensio;,citation_author=Gerardo Sánchez-Martínez;,citation_author=Cristina Linares;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121000608;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.envres.2021.110766;,citation_issn=0013-9351;,citation_journal_title=Environmental Research;">

The method makes fewer assumptions about the distribution of the responses than the more usual approaches such as comparisons of means, MANOVA or ordinal data methods. The approach transforms the Likert responses into paired comparison responses between the items. The complete multivariate pattern of responses thus produced can be analyzed by an appropriately reformulated paired comparison model. The dependency structure between item responses can also be modelled flexibly. The advantage of this approach is that sets of Likert responses can be analyzed simultaneously within the Generalized Linear Model framework, providing standard likelihood-based inference for model selection.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assessing soundscape disturbance through hierarchical models and acoustic indices: A case study on a shelterwood logged northern Michigan forest;,citation_abstract=Assessing the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on wildlife and natural resources is a necessary conservation task. The soundscape is a critical habitat component for acoustically communicating organisms, but the use of the soundscape as a tool for assessing disturbance impacts has been relatively unexplored until recently. Here we present a broad modeling framework for assessing disturbance impacts on soundscapes, which we apply to quantify the influence of a shelterwood logging on soundscapes in northern Michigan. Our modeling approach can be broadly applied to assess anthropogenic disturbance impacts on soundscapes. The approach accommodates inherent differences in control and treatment sites to improve inference about treatment effects, while also accounting for extraneous variables (e.g., rain) that influence acoustic indices. Recordings were obtained at 13 sites before and after a shelterwood logging. Four sites were in the logging region and nine sites served as control recordings outside the logging region. We quantify the soundscapes using common acoustic indices (Normalized Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI), Acoustic Entropy (H), Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), Acoustic Evenness Index (AEI)) and Welch Power Spectral Density (PSD) values. We build two hierarchical Bayesian models to quantify the changes in the soundscape over the study period. Our analysis reveals no long-lasting effects of the shelterwood logging on the soundscape as measured by the NDSI, but analysis of H, AEI, and PSD suggest changes in the evenness of sounds across the frequency spectrum, indicating a potential shift in the avian species communicating in the soundscapes as a result of the logging. Further, our analysis confirms previous findings that the ACI does not accurately reflect changes in landscape configuration. Multiple model validation techniques (i.e., comparison of parameter estimates and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC)) reveal our proposed hierarchical Bayesian models outperform more simple models used for hypothesis testing. Acoustic recordings, in conjunction with this modeling framework, can deliver cost efficient assessment of disturbance impacts on the landscape and underlying biodiversity as represented through the soundscape.;,citation_author=Jeffrey W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using Virtual Reality for assessing the role of noise in the audio-visual design of an urban public space;,citation_abstract=Sound planning is not often included in the urban design process despite the well-known audio-visual interactions of human perception. A methodology to compare the overall appreciation of future renovation alternatives of urban public spaces using Virtual Reality Technology is proposed. This method is applied to assess the role of noise in the overall appreciation of a walk on a bridge crossing a highway. The auralization is a dynamic 3D surround based on B-format recordings (ambisonics), filtered by means of full-wave numerical calculations obtaining the sound field behind noise barriers along the bridge’s edge. Four different styles of visual street design including different noise barrier heights in combination with the 4 corresponding predicted sound fields were evaluated for their pleasantness by 71 normal-hearing participants on 4 separate days. Each day participants experienced all the visual environments with only one soundscape (to elude direct sound comparison) and anything related to sound was not mentioned in the first part of the experiment. Even in this non-focussed context, a statistically significant effect of the sound environment on the overall appreciation was found. In general, the pleasantness increases with traffic noise level reduction, but the visual design has a stronger impact. By mentioning the soundscape while introducing the evaluation, slightly lower (but statistically significantly different) pleasantness ratings were obtained. Instead of increasing noise barrier height, improving the visual design of a lower barrier seems more effective to increase pleasantness. Visual designs including vegetation strongly outperform others. The virtual experience was rated as immersive and realistic.;,citation_author=Gemma Maria Echevarria Sanchez;,citation_author=Timothy Van Renterghem;,citation_author=Kang Sun;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_publication_date=2017-05;,citation_cover_date=2017-05;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.05.018;,citation_issn=0169-2046;,citation_volume=167;,citation_journal_title=Landscape and Urban Planning;,citation_publisher=Elsevier B.V.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acoustic structure of the five perceptual dimensions of timbre in orchestral instrument tones;,citation_abstract=Attempts to relate the perceptual dimensions of timbre to quantitative acoustical dimensions have been tenuous, leading to claims that timbre is an emergent property, if measurable at all. Here, a three-pronged analysis shows that the timbre space of sustained instrument tones occupies 5 dimensions and that a specific combination of acoustic properties uniquely determines gestalt perception of timbre. Firstly, multidimensional scaling (MDS) of dissimilarity judgments generated a perceptual timbre space in which 5 dimensions were cross-validated and selected by traditional model comparisons. Secondly, subjects rated tones on semantic scales. A discriminant function analysis (DFA) accounting for variance of these semantic ratings across instruments and between subjects also yielded 5 significant dimensions with similar stimulus ordination. The dimensions of timbre space were then interpreted semantically by rotational and reflectional projection of the MDS solution into two DFA dimensions. Thirdly, to relate this final space to acoustical structure, the perceptual MDS coordinates of each sound were regressed with its joint spectrotemporal modulation power spectrum. Sound structures correlated significantly with distances in perceptual timbre space. Contrary to previous studies, most perceptual timbre dimensions are not the result of purely temporal or spectral features but instead depend on signature spectrotemporal patterns.;,citation_author=Taffeta M.

An analysis of the corpus shows that participants have a high level of agreement on the valence and arousal of soundscapes. We generate a gold standard by averaging users’ responses, and we verify the corpus by training stepwise linear regression models and support vector regression models.

In recent years, studies have also indicated that the socially disadvantaged are more susceptible to environmental hazards such as noise pollution. This paper aims to fill a gap in literature though the evaluation of urban soundscapes by analysing the spatiotemporal patterns of acoustic events within selected New York City (NYC) neighbourhoods and comparing the datum to the socio-econois data of the urban environments. In this paper, the author aims to address this question, ’Does racial/ethnic composition of each neighbourhood influence how acoustic events are distributed, and in what way does this related to the socio-economic status of each location?’ This study focuses on seven neighbourhoods within the New York City metropolitan area, each location representing one of the seven levels of noise metadata found on NYC’s 311 noise map. The ambient soundscape of each location was recorded for 30 minutes over four different time intervals across three days, comprising in a total of 45 hours of raw data. Acoustic events were extracted and annotated for saliency and classed according to soundscape components, which were then compared against the racial/ethnic demography of NYC. The findings in this study partially aligned with past research in which communities of lower socio-economic status with higher proportions of non-Caucasion communities were susceptible to higher levels of noise exposure. Additionally, this study also aligned with the hypothesis that high numbers of acoustic events negatively correlate to the socio-economic composition of neighbourhoods.;,citation_author=Shuraifa Asmah Shad Saleem Faruqi;,citation_author=Shuraifa Asmah;,citation_author=Shad Saleem;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=November;,citation_isbn=9789832084433;,citation_volume=7;,citation_journal_title=Malaysian Journal of Music;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does it make a difference to have soundscape standards ?;,citation_abstract=Soundscape investigations remarkably gain in importance. Due to the holistic concept of soundscape there is a broad diversity of methods and tools in this field ranging from nonparticipatory observational methods over narrative interviews to the use of more or less fully structured questionnaires. This large variety of used methods and tools for data collection impedes the comparability of studies and the aggregation of data over different soundscape investigations to perform meta-analyses. In order to reach consensus about how to measure soundscape appropriately, a set of established and acknowledged soundscape methods and tools is needed. In this regard, soundscape standards one the one hand can stimulate discussions about pros and cons of different soundscape methods and tools and on the other hand could provide a common basis, where researchers and investigators can start from. The extensive application of standards can lead to new insights into the shortcomings and drawbacks of the standards, which can provoke necessary revisions in the future. However, in the context of the soundscape approach it might be justified to ask in general whether a holistic concept can be subject to standardization at all without violating the principle of holism.;,citation_author=André Fiebig;,citation_publication_date=2018-06;,citation_cover_date=2018-06;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.euronoise2018.eu/docs/papers/482_Euronoise2018.pdf;,citation_issue=June;,citation_journal_title=Proceedings - Euronoise 2018;">

Due to the omnipresence of noise, the perception of nosie has a strong impact on the well-being and life-quality of human beings. By means of cognitive processes, meaning is assigned to the world around us following rules with an inherent logic. A specific aspect concerns how humans retrospectibely form overall assessments of hedonic or sensational profiles as they experience environmental noise. If humans are requested to provide an overall assessment of an environment regarding for example annoyance, pleasantness or restorativeness, they have to retrospectively assign a magnitude of perception or affective appraisal to the experience past period. Since experiences of environments typically change over time, a deeper understanding of the cognitive processing of time-variant experiences is needed. This processing is quintessentially contextual affecting auditory sensation, the interpretation of auditory sensation, and the responses to the acoustic environment. Frequently it can be observed that people rely more on patterns and key moments of episodes instead of averaging equally the whole stream of momentary experiences like a sound level meter does.;,citation_author=André Fiebig;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_conference_title=INTER-NOISE 2019 - noise control for a better environment;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Auditory sensory saliency as a better predictor of change than sound amplitude in pleasantness assessment of reproduced urban soundscapes;,citation_abstract=The sonic environment of the urban public space is often experienced while walking through it. Nevertheless, city dwellers are usually not actively listening to the environment when traversing the city. Therefore, sound events that are salient, i.e. stand out of the sonic environment, are the ones that trigger attention and contribute highly to the perception of the soundscape. In a previously reported audiovisual perception experiment, the pleasantness of a recorded urban sound walk was continuously evaluated by a group of participants. To detect salient events in the soundscape, a biologically-inspired computational model for auditory sensory saliency based on spectrotemporal modulations is proposed. Using the data from a sound walk, the present study validates the hypothesis that salient events detected by the model contribute to changes in soundscape rating and are therefore important when evaluating the urban soundscape. Finally, when using the data from an additional experiment without a strong visual component, the importance of auditory sensory saliency as a predictor for change in pleasantness assessment is found to be even more pronounced.;,citation_author=Karlo Filipan;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Pierre Aumond;,citation_author=Arnaud Can;,citation_author=Catherine Lavandier;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.054;,citation_issn=0360-1323;,citation_volume=148;,citation_journal_title=Building and Environment;,citation_publisher=Elsevier Ltd;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine recognition of timbre using steady-state tone of acoustic musical instruments;,citation_abstract=Recent experiments indicate that steady-state portion of an acoustic musical instrument may be sufficient for timbre recognition. Here a computer-based classifier was used to recognize very short samples of steady-state tones. Gregory Sandell’s SHARC database consisted of 39 different timbre (23 orchestral instruments, some with different articulations) played at different pitches (total of 1338 spectra) were used as the samples for an exemplar-based learning system that incorporates k-nearest neighbor classifier with genetic algorithm. The latter is used to find the optimal set of weights for the features to improve the classification. The features calculated from the spectral data of the steady-state portion of the instrumental sound included centroid and other moments, such as skewness and kurtosis. As expected the centroid alone was the best single feature with a recognition rate of 20%, which is much better than chance (2.5%). The best results were obtained using seven features: the fundamental, the integral of the spectrum, the centroid, the standard deviation, the skewness, and the first two harmonic partials. What was surprising was that the recognition varied greatly between instruments. While the French horn and the muted trumpet were recognized over 90%, the recognition of other instruments, such as the cello with martele (18%), and the violin pizzicato (14%) were very poor. The average overall was 50.3%. Introduction A timbre recognition experiment to classify 39 different orchestral instrument timbres was conducted using an exemplar-based learning system. The data consisted of the steady-state spectrum of each of the instruments played at different pitches (Sandell 1994). It has been shown that the attack portion of a musical instrument is important for identification tasks. Yet other studies show that steady-state portion is also significant (Grey 1978; Kendall and Carterette 1986). In addition to the spectral data, the moments of the spectrum, including the centroid, were considered as potential features for the identification process. The implementation of the identification task is based on a combination of a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier and a genetic algorithm, which is used for feature selection and feature weighting. This paradigm, also known as the exemplar-based learning model (Aha 1997), is attractive because training is not necessary, learning is extremely fast, algorithms are simple and intuitive, rules are not sought, and learning is incremental. The major drawback has been the high memory requirement since all examples must be stored, but the recent decrease in memory cost makes this model quite feasible.;,citation_author=Ichiro Fujinaga;,citation_publication_date=1998;,citation_cover_date=1998;,citation_year=1998;,citation_journal_title=Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference (ICMC);">

Traditionally, research on urban noise was conducted through surveys with a limited temporal and spatial coverage, and focused on a subset of the wide spectrum of sounds sources present in an urban environment. To overcome these limitations, we use geo-referenced social media images from Flickr to characterize the soundscape of London at scale. We build a model that uses socioeconomic variables, official noise exposure levels, and the soundscape estimated from social media to predict at area level the prevalence of hypertension-a cardiovascular condition that is widely studied in connection to high noise exposure. We consistently observe that socioeconomic variables, such as age, gender, and income, play an important role in explaining hypertension rates. Official noise exposure levels add a relatively limited contribution in predicting the health outcome. On the contrary, the social media soundscape information considerably improves the model performance. This result speaks to the value of integrating social media data into strategic noise maps for enhancing their predictive power; it also hints at the fact that the presence (or absence) of specific types of sounds might be a better indicator of hypertension prevalence than noise levels themselves.;,citation_author=Luis Gasco;,citation_author=Rossano Schifanella;,citation_author=Luca Maria Aiello;,citation_author=Daniele Quercia;,citation_author=Cesar Asensio;,citation_author=Guillermo Arcas;,citation_publication_date=2020-09;,citation_cover_date=2020-09;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.3389/frsc.2020.00041;,citation_issn=2624-9634;,citation_volume=2;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Sustainable Cities;,citation_publisher=Frontiers Media SA;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dynamic Acoustic Measurement Techniques Considering Human Perception;,citation_abstract=Dynamic measurement implies determining the content of signals having$\backslash$nspectral structure and energy changing with time, sometimes on very$\backslash$nshort time scales. Dynamic measurements can present challenges to$\backslash$ndetermine sufficient information in both the time and frequency domains.$\backslash$nHigh resolution in frequency prevents finding short-term peak levels and$\backslash$nrecognizing true crest factors, and vice versa. The human ear/brain$\backslash$nsystem exceeds the simultaneous time and frequency recognition of$\backslash$nconventional measurement methods, further complicating the challenge.$\backslash$nPeople have at least three times better time/frequency resolution than$\backslash$nthe familiar Fourier transform moved across the time axis, although$\backslash$nquite often a compromise block size can be found that gives$\backslash$ntime/frequency measurement agreeing with human sound perception of both$\backslash$nfactors. Unlike technical measuring systems, human hearing is also very$\backslash$nsensitive to patterns. The presence of tones, varying tones ( amplitude$\backslash$nand/or frequency), clicks, rattles, splashing sounds, etc., even at low$\backslash$nlevels in the presence of other less structured noise of considerably$\backslash$nhigher level, can dominate perception. Human consciousness effectively$\backslash$nperforms the opposite of averaging, ignoring the absolute value of$\backslash$nslowly varying or stationary signals and focusing on things differing at$\backslash$nshort time bases from their surroundings in both time and frequency. In$\backslash$ndynamic measurement, it can be difficult to withdraw an important$\backslash$npattern from the absolute whole. Case studies will be given comparing$\backslash$nconventional techniques with three high-resolution time/frequency$\backslash$nmethods useful in general engineering although developed to model the$\backslash$nprocesses of human sound perception: a hearing model with very rapid$\backslash$ntime resolution at all frequencies (Sottek, R., 1993, “Modelle zur$\backslash$nSignalverarbeitung im menschlichen Gehor,{”} dissertation, RWTH$\backslash$nAachen), a relative ( pattern) measurement technique subtracting a$\backslash$nsliding average in both time and frequency from a running instantaneous$\backslash$nspectrum (Genuit, K., 1996, “ A New Approach to Objective Determination$\backslash$nof Noise Quality Based on Relative Parameters,{”} Proceedings of$\backslash$nInterNoise, Liverpool, UK), and a Fourier-based window deconvolution$\backslash$nmethod giving pure spectral lines regardless of signal-to-block$\backslash$nsynchronization and permitting multiplication of frequency resolution$\backslash$nfor a given block length and time resolution ( Sottek, R., 1993, “$\backslash$nModelle zur Signalverarbeitung im menschlichen Gehor,{”} dissertation,$\backslash$nRWTH Aachen; Bray, W.

By only relying on sound pressure levels averaged over long time periods and by suppressing all aspects of quality, the specific acoustic properties of environmental noise situations cannot be identified. Because annoyance caused by environmental noise has a broader linkage with various acoustical properties such as frequency spectrum, duration, impulsive, tonal and low-frequency components, etc. than only with SPL [1]. In many cases these acoustical properties affect the quality of life. The human cognitive signal processing pays attention to further factors than only to the averaged intensity of the acoustical stimulus. Therefore, it appears inevitable to use further hearing-related parameters to improve the description and evaluation of environmental noise. A first step regarding the adequate description of environmental noise would be the extended application of existing measurement tools, as for example level meter with variable integration time and third octave analyzer, which offer valuable clues to disturbing patterns. Moreover, the use of psychoacoustics will allow the improved capturing of soundscape qualities.;,citation_author=Klaus Genuit;,citation_author=André Fiebig;,citation_publication_date=2006;,citation_cover_date=2006;,citation_year=2006;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233487609;,citation_volume=92;">

To this end, the present article aims to give a more widely accessible derivation of the GFPE algorithm than was given originally by Gilbert and Di [(1993). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 94, 2343-2352]. The present derivation, which uses mathematics familiar to most engineers and physicists, begins with the separation of variables method, a basic and well-known approach for solving partial differential equations. The method leads naturally to eigenvalue-eigenfunction equations. A step-by-step analysis arrives at relatively simple, analytic expressions for the horizontal and vertical eigenfunctions, which are sinusoids plus a surface wave. The eigenfunctions are superposed in an eigenfunction expansion to yield a one-way propagation solution. The one-way solution is generalized to obtain the GFPE algorithm. In addition, and equally important, the eigenfunctions are used to give concrete meaning to abstract operator solutions for one-way acoustic propagation. By using an eigenfunction expansion of the acoustic field, together with an operator solution, one can obtain the GFPE algorithm very directly and concisely.;,citation_author=Kenneth E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Categorization of environmental sounds;,citation_abstract=his paper investigates the way in which people categorize environmental sounds in their everyday lives. Previous research has shown that isolated environmental sounds are categorized on the basis of high-level semantic features when the sounds can be attributed to specific sound sources. However, in the presence of numerous sound sources, as occur in most real-world situations, the process of source identification is often hindered. In the present study, a free categorization task with open-ended verbal descriptions was used to investigate auditory categories for environmental sounds in complex real-world sonic environments. Two main categories emerged from the free-sort, reflecting the absence or presence of human activity in relation to hedonic judgments. At a subordinate level, subcategories were mediated by the participant’s reported interactions with the environment through socialized activities. The spontaneous verbal descriptors collected were successful in discriminating categories. These findings indicate that complex environmental sounds are processed and categorized as meaningful events providing relevant information about the environment. The relevance of situational factors in categorization and the notion of auditory category in its relation to linguistic labeling are then discussed.

To examine the contribution of temporal factors, in experiment 3 vocoder methods were used to create event-modulated noises (EMN) which had extremely limited spectral information. About half of the 70 EMN were identifiable on the basis of the temporal patterning. Multiple regression analysis suggested that some acoustic features listeners may use to identify EMN include envelope shape, periodicity, and the consistency of temporal changes across frequency channels. Identification performance with high- and low-pass filtered environmental sounds varied in a manner similar to that of speech sounds, except that there seemed to be somewhat more information in the higher frequencies for the environmental sounds used in this experiment.;,citation_author=Brian Gygi;,citation_author=Gary R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Incongruency Advantage for Environmental Sounds Presented in Natural Auditory Scenes;,citation_abstract=The effect of context on the identification of common environmental sounds (e.g., dogs barking or cars honking) was tested by embedding them in familiar auditory background scenes (street ambience, restaurants). Initial results with subjects trained on both the scenes and the sounds to be identified showed a significant advantage of about five percentage points better accuracy for sounds that were contextually incongruous with the background scene (e.g., a rooster crowing in a hospital). Further studies with naive (untrained) listeners showed that this incongruency advantage (IA) is level-dependent: there is no advantage for incongruent sounds lower than a Sound/Scene ratio (So/Sc) of -7.5 dB, but there is about five percentage points better accuracy for sounds with greater So/Sc. Testing a new group of trained listeners on a larger corpus of sounds and scenes showed that the effect is robust and not confined to a specific stimulus set. Modeling using spectral-temporal measures showed that neither analyses based on acoustic features, nor semantic assessments of sound-scene congruency can account for this difference, indicating the IA is a complex effect, possibly arising from the sensitivity of the auditory system to new and unexpected events, under particular listening conditions.;,citation_author=Brian Gygi;,citation_author=Valeriy Shafiro;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1037/a0020671;,citation_issn=0096-1523;,citation_pmid=21355664;,citation_volume=37;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Examining Functional Content in Widely Used Health-Related Quality of Life Scales;,citation_abstract=Purpose: Assess extent to which generic Quality of Life (QOL) and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) scales include function in assessment of health, and identify health assessment items that are free of functional content. Methods: An expert panel on measurement of health and disability reached consensus on definitions of health, disability, and function. They assessed all items of all generic (non-condition-specific) scales in the 2006 ProQolid database for being important to measuring health as distinct from function. Ratings were summarized as content validity ratios. Retained items were written into standard format and reviewed again by the expert panel and a validity panel with expertise in specific disabilities. Results: Of 85 scales, 21 were retained as containing items important for assessing health. Scales ranged from 100% (BRFSS HRQOL, WHO-5) to only 4% of items rated as important. In further review of &amp;amp;amp;quot;important&amp;quot; items, functional content was identified in many of the items, particularly with regard to mental functioning. Conclusions: Popular generic scales of QOL and HRQOL vary greatly in the degree to which they include content on function. A pool of items can be identified that are relatively free of function. Distinguishing measurement of function and health is particularly important for people with long-standing functional limitations and for assessing the relationship of health with function.;,citation_author=Trevor Hall;,citation_author=Gloria L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An exploratory evaluation of perceptual, psychoacoustic and acoustical properties of urban soundscapes;,citation_abstract=The present study reports an exploration of the multi-dimensional space involved in listening to sound-scape recordings made in different city-based settings. A range of perceptual, psychoacoustic and acous-tical properties were examined using a range of statistical methods including principal components analysis and multiple regression. Just as the affective responses to individual sound sources have often been described in terms of pleasantness and arousal (or vibrancy), so could the acoustic scenarios of urban life. However, different from previous research, the acoustic and psychoacoustic variables contributed very little to judgements about pleasantness and vibrancy. We surmise that the perceived quality of the soundscape is very much an individual subjective experience that is likely to be embedded within contextual domain and that it probably relates to personal preference, past history and other social and cultural factors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Going beyond Quietness: Determining the Emotionally Restorative Effect of Acoustic Environments in Urban Open Public Spaces;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The capacity of natural settings to promote psychological restoration has attracted increasing research attention, especially with regards to the visual dimension. However, there is a need to extend these studies to urban settings, such as squares, parks or gardens, due to the global trend towards urbanisation, and to integrate the dimension of sound into landscape. Such was the main aim of this study, in which 53 participants assessed four public spaces in Vitoria-Gasteiz (Spain) as part of the CITI-SENSE Project (137 observations were used for analysis). A smartphone application was used to simultaneously collect objective and subjective data. The results show that at the end of the urban environmental experience, there was a statistically significant reduction in negative emotions and perceived stress, and a slight increase in positive emotions. Emotional restoration was mainly associated with prior emotional states, but also with global environmental comfort and acoustic comfort. The soundscape characteristics that contributed to greater emotional restoration and a reduction in perceived stress were pleasantness, calm, fun and naturalness. Therefore, in agreement with previous research, the findings of the present study indicate that besides contributing to the quietness of the urban environment, the urban soundscape can promote psychological restoration in users of these spaces.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;;,citation_author=Karmele Herranz-Pascual;,citation_author=Itziar Aspuru;,citation_author=Ioseba Iraurgi;,citation_author=Álvaro Santander;,citation_author=Jose Luis Eguiguren;,citation_author=Igone García;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/7/1284;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.3390/ijerph16071284;,citation_isbn=3490276000;,citation_issn=1660-4601;,citation_volume=16;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Quality assessment of acoustic environment reproduction methods for cinematic virtual reality in soundscape applications;,citation_abstract=With the advent of virtual reality (VR) technology, spatial audio has been increasingly adopted to evaluate the acoustic environment in soundscape research. It is therefore imperative to assess the quality of commonly used spatial audio reproduction methods to determine their ecological validity. Through subjective evaluations with 30 participants, the same participant evaluated four outdoor in situ locations vis-à-vis its corresponding audio- visual recording in VR on a separate day. A total of three spatial audio reproduction methods were assessed in VR, and they were all down-mixed from the first-order ambisonics (FOA) recordings to headphone-based FOA- static binaural, FOA-tracked binaural; and FOA 2-dimensional (2D) octagonal speaker array. The participants evaluated the acoustic environment in terms of the overall soundscape quality and perceived spatial qualities at each location. Regarding overall soundscape quality, there were no significant differences in evaluating the sound-source dominance and affective soundscape qualities between in situ and all VR methods. However, significant differences were found in the perceived spatial qualities between three reproduction methods and in situ. Among the source-related spatial attributes, the perceived distance of the dominating sounds was farther in the virtual than in the in situ evaluations. In the localization of sound sources, both the FOA-tracked binaural and the FOA-2D speaker array exhibited higher spatial acoustic fidelity than FOA-static binaural. Regarding the environment-related spatial quality attributes, the 2D speaker array reproduction was perceived as more im- mersive and realistic than other reproduction methods. Overall, the FOA-tracked binaural appears to exhibit sufficient fidelity for cinematic VR evaluation of soundscapes.;,citation_author=Joo Young Hong;,citation_author=Bhan Lam;,citation_author=Zhen-Ting Ting Ong;,citation_author=Kenneth Ooi;,citation_author=Woon-Seng Seng Gan;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_author=Feng Jing;,citation_author=Sze-Tiong Tiong Tan;,citation_author=Jing Feng;,citation_author=Sze-Tiong Tiong Tan;,citation_publication_date=2018-05;,citation_cover_date=2018-05;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.12.004;,citation_issn=0360-1323;,citation_volume=149;,citation_journal_title=Building and Environment;,citation_publisher=Elsevier;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive persistence of soundscape in urban parks;,citation_abstract=Cognition of soundscape information affects an individual’s preference and understanding soundscapes in urban parks. This study explored the cognitive persistence of soundscape and the factors that influence cognitive soundscape in urban parks. Landscape information was collected at 36 observation sites in three parks. The duration of soundscape samples at each site heard by the observers were divided into 10s, 20s, 30s. The observers in different groups were required to start filling out the questionnaire following the different time. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) produced three principal components of cognitive soundscape, loudness cognition, harmonious cognition, and directional cognition. Three hierarchical Cluster Analyses contributed to to finding the variation characteristics of the factors from PCA in different intervals. A model using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) provided a prediction of cognitive soundscape attenuation. Results indicate that the optimal cognitive persistence of soundscape is 20s to maintain the cognitive soundscape, and the influencing factors include soundscape and lightscape.The classified indicators from PCA were more effective in forecasting than those that were unclassified after ANN training. Overall, the soundscape, lightscape, and space together play a key role in the cognitive persistence of soundscape.;,citation_author=Xinchen Hong;,citation_author=Guangyu Wang;,citation_author=Jiang Liu;,citation_author=Siren Lan;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.scs.2019.101706;,citation_issn=2210-6707;,citation_journal_title=Sustainable Cities and Society;,citation_publisher=Elsevier B.V.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of contexts in urban residential areas on the pleasantness and appropriateness of natural sounds;,citation_abstract=Before introducing natural sounds to potentially improve the soundscape quality, it is important to understand how key contextual factors (i.e. expected activities and audio-visual congruency) affect the soundscape in a given location. In this study, the perception of eight natural sounds (i.e. 4 birdsongs, 4 water sounds) at five urban recreational areas under the constant influence of road traffic was explored subjectively under three laboratory settings: visual-only, audio-only, and audio-visual. Firstly, expected socio-recreational activities of each location were determined in the visual-only setting. Subsequently, participants assessed the pleasantness and aprropriateness of the soundacape at each site, for each of the eight natural sounds augmented to the same road traffic noise, in both audio-only and audio-visual settings. Interestingly, it was found that the expected activities in each location did not significantly affect natural sound perception, whereas audio-visual congruency of the locations significantly affected the pleasantness and appropriateness of the natural sounds. Particularly, the pleasantness and appropriateness decreased for water sounds when water features were not visually present. In contrast, perception with birdsongs was unaffected by their visibility likely due to the presence of vegetation. Hence, audio-visual coherence is central to the perception of natural sounds in outdoor spaces.;,citation_author=Joo Young Hong;,citation_author=Bhan Lam;,citation_author=Zhen-Ting Ong;,citation_author=Kenneth Ooi;,citation_author=Woon-Seng Gan;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_author=Samuel Yeong;,citation_author=Irene Lee;,citation_author=Sze-Tiong Tan;,citation_publication_date=2020-12;,citation_cover_date=2020-12;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.scs.2020.102475;,citation_issn=2210-6707;,citation_volume=63;,citation_journal_title=Sustainable Cities and Society;,citation_publisher=Elsevier Ltd;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perception of water-based masking sounds-long-term experiment in an open-plan office;,citation_abstract=A certain level of masking sound is necessary to control the disturbance caused by speech sounds in open-plan offices. The sound is usually provided with evenly distributed loudspeakers. Pseudo-random noise is often used as a source of artificial sound masking (PRMS). A recent laboratory experiment suggested that water-based masking sound (WBMS) could be more favorable than PRMS. The purpose of our study was to determine how the employees perceived different WBMSs compared to PRMS. The experiment was conducted in an open-plan office of 77 employees who had been accustomed to work under PRMS (44 dB LAeq). The experiment consisted of five masking conditions: the original PRMS, four different WBMSs and return to the original PRMS. The exposure time of each condition was 3 weeks. The noise level was nearly equal between the conditions (43-45 dB LAeq) but the spectra and the nature of the sounds were very different. A questionnaire was completed at the end of each condition. Acoustic satisfaction was worse during the WBMSs than during the PRMS. The disturbance caused by three out of four WBMSs was larger than that of PRMS. Several attributes describing the sound quality itself were in favor of PRMS. Colleagues’ speech sounds disturbed more during WBMSs. None of the WBMSs produced better subjective ratings than PRMS. Although the first WBMS was equal with the PRMS for several variables, the overall results cannot be seen to support the use of WBMSs in office workplaces. Because the experiment suffered from some methodological weaknesses, conclusions about the adequacy of WBMSs cannot yet be drawn.;,citation_author=Valtteri Hongistob;,citation_author=Johanna Varjo;,citation_author=David Oliva;,citation_author=Annu Haapakangas;,citation_author=Evan Benway;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=JUL;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01177;,citation_issn=1664-1078;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=AI-based soundscape analysis: Jointly identifying sound sources and predicting annoyance;,citation_abstract=Soundscape studies typically attempt to capture the perception and understanding of sonic environments by surveying users. However, for long-term monitoring or assessing interventions, sound-signal-based approaches are required. To this end, most previous research focused on psycho-acoustic quantities or automatic sound recognition. Few attempts were made to include appraisal (e.g., in circumplex frameworks). This paper proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based dual-branch convolutional neural network with cross-attention-based fusion (DCNN-CaF) to analyze automatic soundscape characterization, including sound recognition and appraisal. Using the DeLTA dataset containing human-annotated sound source labels and perceived annoyance, the DCNN-CaF is proposed to perform sound source classification (SSC) and human-perceived annoyance rating prediction (ARP). Experimental findings indicate that (1) the proposed DCNN-CaF using loudness and Mel features outperforms the DCNN-CaF using only one of them. (2) The proposed DCNN-CaF with cross-attention fusion outperforms other typical AI-based models and soundscape-related traditional machine learning methods on the SSC and ARP tasks. (3) Correlation analysis reveals that the relationship between sound sources and annoyance is similar for humans and the proposed AI-based DCNN-CaF model. (4) Generalization tests show that the proposed model’s ARP in the presence of model-unknown sound sources is consistent with expert expectations and can explain previous findings from the literature on soundscape augmentation.;,citation_author=Yuanbo Hou;,citation_author=Qiaoqiao Ren;,citation_author=Huizhong Zhang;,citation_author=Andrew Mitchell;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_publication_date=2023-11;,citation_cover_date=2023-11;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1121/10.0022408;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_volume=154;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Optimal number of features as a function of sample size for various classification rules;,citation_abstract=MOTIVATION: Given the joint feature-label distribution, increasing the number of features always results in decreased classification error; however, this is not the case when a classifier is designed via a classification rule from sample data. Typically (but not always), for fixed sample size, the error of a designed classifier decreases and then increases as the number of features grows. The potential downside of using too many features is most critical for small samples, which are commonplace for gene-expression-based classifiers for phenotype discrimination. For fixed sample size and feature-label distribution, the issue is to find an optimal number of features. RESULTS: Since only in rare cases is there a known distribution of the error as a function of the number of features and sample size, this study employs simulation for various feature-label distributions and classification rules, and across a wide range of sample and feature-set sizes. To achieve the desired end, finding the optimal number of features as a function of sample size, it employs massively parallel computation. Seven classifiers are treated: 3-nearest-neighbor, Gaussian kernel, linear support vector machine, polynomial support vector machine, perceptron, regular histogram and linear discriminant analysis. Three Gaussian-based models are considered: linear, nonlinear and bimodal. In addition, real patient data from a large breast-cancer study is considered. To mitigate the combinatorial search for finding optimal feature sets, and to model the situation in which subsets of genes are co-regulated and correlation is internal to these subsets, we assume that the covariance matrix of the features is blocked, with each block corresponding to a group of correlated features. Altogether there are a large number of error surfaces for the many cases. These are provided in full on a companion website, which is meant to serve as resource for those working with small-sample classification.

While its underlying processes are extensively studied in vision, mechanisms of auditory salience remain largely unknown. Previous studies have used well-controlled auditory scenes to shed light on some of the acoustic attributes that drive the salience of sound events. Unfortunately, the use of constrained stimuli in addition to a lack of well-established benchmarks of salience judgments hampers the development of comprehensive theories of sensory-driven auditory attention. The present study explores auditory salience in a set of dynamic natural scenes. A behavioral measure of salience is collected by having human volunteers listen to two concurrent scenes and indicate continuously which one attracts their attention.

Qualitative analysis was also made using semantic scales for evaluating the quality of the soundscape, and it was shown that the perception of acoustic comfort and loudness was strongly related to the annoyance. A laboratory auditory experiment was then conducted in order to quantify the total annoyance caused by road traffic noise and four types of construction noise. It was shown that the annoyance ratings were related to the types of construction noise in combination with road traffic noise and the level of the road traffic noise.

For qualitative analysis, a semantic differential test was performed in the form of a social survey, and subjects were also asked to describe their impressions during a soundwalk. The results showed that urban soundscapes can be characterized by soundmarks, and soundscape perceptions are dominated by acoustic comfort, visual images, and day lighting, whereas reverberance in urban spaces does not yield consistent preference judgments. It is posited that the subjective evaluation of reverberance can be replaced by physical measurements. The categories extracted from the qualitative analysis revealed that spatial impressions such as openness and density emerged as some of the contexts of soundscape perception.;,citation_author=Jin Yong Jeon;,citation_author=Pyoung Jik Lee;,citation_author=Joo Young Hong;,citation_author=Densil Cabrera;,citation_publication_date=2011;,citation_cover_date=2011;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.3652902;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_pmid=22225033;,citation_volume=130;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A cross-national comparison in assessment of urban park soundscapes in France, Korea, and Sweden through laboratory experiments;,citation_abstract=This study aims at examining the effect of socio-cultural context, including language, on soundscape assessments in urban parks. In total, 95 persons took part in three laboratory experiments, conducted in France (30 participants), Korea (30 participants) and Sweden (35 participants). Twenty-eight audio-visual excerpts from recordings conducted in five urban parks were used as stimuli. The participants evaluated soundscape quality using attribute scales provided in their own native languages. Principal Components Analysis produced two principal components of perceived affective quality, Pleasantness and Eventfulness. There were high levels of similarity in attributes associated with the Pleasantness among the three countries, whereas some differences were observed in the attributes related to Eventfulness. Two hierarchical cluster analyses were conducted based on perceived dominance of sound sources, and component scores of perceived affective quality. There were no significant differences in clustering results based on perceived dominance of sound sources among the different nationalities. In contrast, discrepancies were found in the clustering results based on perceived affective quality. In particular, perceptual responses to human sounds, birdsong, and water sounds, which are closely related to Eventfulness, were significantly different across the three cultural backgrounds. These findings provide empirical evidence of socio-cultural differences in soundscape assessment.;,citation_author=Jin Yong Jeon;,citation_author=Joo Young Hong;,citation_author=Catherine Lavandier;,citation_author=Jeanne Lafon;,citation_author=Östen Axelsson;,citation_author=Malin Hurtig;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2017.12.016;,citation_issn=1872-910X;,citation_journal_title=Applied Acoustics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundscape assessment with classification of human perception to sound environment;,citation_abstract=To investigate the effect of human sound identification differences on urban soundscape perception, we propose the urban soundscape categorization method based on human attention for sound sources. Virtual reality technology was applied with audiovisual data collected in various urban environments to reproduce realistic environment in laboratory condition with high ecological validity. Fifty subject’s response were collected about sound sources identification, perceived affective quality (8 typical attributes and 116 extensive attributes), and overall quality. Human categorization with sound source identification were divided into 3 clusters; cluster 1: attentive to traffic and other noise, cluster 2: less-attentive to sound environment, cluster 3: attentive to natural sound and human-being sound. The results show that soundscape perceptual dimensions were derived differently for each cluster and only the cluster 2 derived new dimension: tranquil and relaxed soundscapes. The soundscape perception model showed that the overall quality assessment according to each cluster are similar in aspect of mean value for each soundscape descriptors, but the indicator which effects on soundscape descriptor are different according to sound source attention.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundscape assessment methods: Compatibility of questionnaires and narrative interview based on ISO 12913-2;,citation_abstract=With the introduction of the concept of soundscape, various studies on soundscape evaluation methods and tools have been proposed. Data collection protocols for such studies have been standardized in ISO 12913-2: method A (questionnaire), method B (questionnaire + narrative interview), and method C (narrative interview). However, the compatibility of responses between assessment tools remains controversial because each researcher uses the protocols considered appropriate for the experimental design depending on their judgment. Therefore, in this study, compatibility of the data collection protocols in the ISO standard is compared in a virtual reality (VR) environment that comprises 10 locations in urban environments with different functions, e.g., parks, public spaces. A total of 50 subjects were asked to answer a variety of questions regarding sound source identification, perceived affective quality, and overall quality-the same soundscape evaluation session was repeated three times. Methods A and B showed highly consistent responses even though their contents were somewhat different. Moreover, the results of method C corresponded well with those of methods A and B in terms of vocabulary frequency and semantic connection. Based on these findings, this study proposes a guideline for using assessment tools for urban soundscape evaluation.;,citation_author=Hyun In Jo;,citation_author=Rosa Seo;,citation_author=Jin Yong Jeon;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343852325;,citation_conference_title=Inter-noise 2020;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Facelift: A transparent deep learning framework to beautify urban scenes;,citation_abstract=In the area of computer vision, deep learning techniques have recently been used to predict whether urban scenes are likely to be considered beautiful: it turns out that these techniques are able to make accurate predictions. Yet they fall short when it comes to generating actionable insights for urban design. To support urban interventions, one needs to go beyond predicting beauty, and tackle the challenge of recreating beauty. Unfortunately, deep learning techniques have not been designed with that challenge in mind. Given their ’black-box nature’, these models cannot be directly used to explain why a particular urban scene is deemed to be beautiful. To partly fix that, we propose a deep learning framework (which we name FaceLift1) that is able to both beautify existing urban scenes (Google Street Views) and explain which urban elements make those transformed scenes beautiful. To quantitatively evaluate our framework, we cannot resort to any existing metric (as the research problem at hand has never been tackled before) and need to formulate new ones. These new metrics should ideally capture the presence (or absence) of elements that make urban spaces great. Upon a review of the urban planning literature, we identify five main metrics: walkability, green spaces, openness, landmarks and visual complexity. We find that, across all the five metrics, the beautified scenes meet the expectations set by the literature on what great spaces tend to be made of. This result is further confirmed by a 20-participant expert survey in which FaceLift has been found to be effective in promoting citizen participation. All this suggests that, in the future, as our framework’s components are further researched and become better and more sophisticated, it is not hard to imagine technologies that will be able to accurately and efficiently support architects and planners in the design of the spaces we intuitively love.;,citation_author=Sagar Joglekar;,citation_author=Daniele Quercia;,citation_author=Miriam Redi;,citation_author=Luca Maria Aiello;,citation_author=Tobias Kauer;,citation_author=Nishanth Sastry;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1098/rsos.190987;,citation_issn=2054-5703;,citation_journal_title=Royal Society Open Science;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Numerical modeling of the sound fields in urban squares;,citation_abstract=This paper studies the basic characteristics of sound fields in urban squares surrounded by reflecting building façades and the effectiveness of architectural changes and urban design options. A radiosity model and an image source model are developed, and a parametric study is carried out in hypothetical squares. The results show that the reverberation time (RT) is rather even in a square, whereas the early decay time (EDT) is very low in the near field, and then becomes close to RT after a rapid increase. Compared to diffuse boundaries, with geometrical boundaries the RT and EDT are significantly longer and the sound pressure level (SPL) attenuation with distance is generally smaller unless the height/side ratio is high. With a boundary diffusion coefficient of 0.2, the sound field is already close to that resulting from purely diffusely reflecting boundaries. The SPL in far field is typically 6-9 dB lower if the square side is doubled; 8 dB lower if the height of building façades is decreased from 50 m to 6 m (diffuse boundaries); 5 dB (diffuse boundaries) or 2 dB (geometrical boundaries) lower if the length/width ratio is increased from 1 to 4; and 10-12 dB lower if the boundary absorption coefficient is increased from 0.1 to 0.9.;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_publication_date=2005-07;,citation_cover_date=2005-07;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.1904483;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_pmid=16018473;,citation_volume=117;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Semantic differential analysis of the soundscape in urban open public spaces;,citation_abstract=The main objective of this research was to identify factors that characterise the soundscape in urban open public spaces. The research was carried out through a series of field surveys. Stage one, as a pilot study, was a soundscape walk with 48 students in four typical urban open public spaces in Sheffield. Stage two was a detailed soundscape evaluation in two of the sites, with a total sample size of 491 from the general public. Stage three examined the soundscape evaluation by designers, with 223 architectural students. Semantic differential analysis of the results shows that although the description and evaluation of the soundscape in urban open public spaces is rather complicated, it is still possible to identify major factors which include relaxation, communication, spatiality and dynamics. In terms of the general soundscape evaluation, differences between sound level and acoustic comfort evaluation, sound preferences, and effects of demographic factors are briefly discussed. Compared to the general public, designers have stronger preferences to natural sounds and green spaces, and there is also more diversity in their evaluation.;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_author=M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modelling auditory attention;,citation_abstract=Sounds in everyday life seldom appear in isolation. Both humans and machines are constantly flooded with a cacophony of sounds that need to be sorted through and scoured for relevant information-a phenomenon referred to as the ’cocktail party problem’. A key component in parsing acoustic scenes is the role of attention, which mediates perception and behaviour by focusing both sensory and cognitive resources on pertinent information in the stimulus space. The current article provides a review of modelling studies of auditory attention. The review highlights how the term attention refers to a multitude of behavioural and cognitive processes that can shape sensory processing. Attention can be modulated by ’bottom-up’ sensory-driven factors, as well as ’top-down’ task-specific goals, expectations and learned schemas. Essentially, it acts as a selection process or processes that focus both sensory and cognitive resources on the most relevant events in the soundscape; with relevance being dictated by the stimulus itself (e.g. a loud explosion) or by a task at hand (e.g. listen to announcements in a busy airport). Recent computational models of auditory attention provide key insights into its role in facilitating perception in cluttered auditory scenes.This article is part of the themed issue ’Auditory and visual scene analysis’.;,citation_author=Emine Merve Kaya;,citation_author=Mounya Elhilali;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=1714;,citation_doi=10.1098/rstb.2016.0101;,citation_issn=1471-2970;,citation_pmid=28044012;,citation_volume=372;,citation_journal_title=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Mechanisms for allocating auditory attention: An auditory saliency map;,citation_abstract=Our nervous system is confronted with a barrage of sensory stimuli, but neural resources are limited and not all stimuli can be processed to the same extent. Mechanisms exist to bias attention toward the particularly salient events, thereby providing a weighted representation of our environment [1]. Our understanding of these mechanisms is still limited, but theoretical models can replicate such a weighting of sensory inputs and provide a basis for understanding the underlying principles [2, 3]. Here, we describe such a model for the auditory system - an auditory saliency map. We experimentally validate the model on natural acoustical scenarios, demonstrating that it reproduces human judgments of auditory saliency and predicts the detectability of salient sounds embedded in noisy backgrounds. In addition, it also predicts the natural orienting behavior of naive macaque monkeys to the same salient stimuli. The structure of the suggested model is identical to that of successfully used visual saliency maps. Hence, we conclude that saliency is determined either by implementing similar mechanisms in different unisensory pathways or by the same mechanism in multisensory areas. In any case, our results demonstrate that different primate sensory systems rely on common principles for extracting relevant sensory events. 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.;,citation_author=Christoph Kayser;,citation_author=Christopher I.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Characterizing urban areas with good sound quality: Development of a research protocol;,citation_abstract=Due to rapid urbanization, the spatial variation between wanted and unwanted sounds will decrease or even disappear. Consequently, the characteristics of (urban) areas where people can temporarily withdraw themselves from urban stressors such as noise may change or become increasingly scarce. Hardly any research has been carried out into the positive health effects of spending time in areas with a good sound quality. One of the problems is that an overview of what aspects determines good sound quality in urban areas and how these are interrelated is lacking. This paper reviews the literature pertaining to the sound quality of urban areas. Aim is to summarize what is known about the influence of social, spatial, and physical aspects other than sounds, on peoples’ perception of urban sound qualities. Literature from both conventional sound research and from the so-called soundscape field, published between 2000 and the beginning of 2013 in English or Dutch, was evaluated. Although a general set of validated indicators that can be directly applied, is not available yet, a set of indicators was derived from the literature. These form the basis of a study protocol that will be applied in &amp;amp;amp;quot;Towards a Sustainable acoustic Environment&amp;quot;, a project that aims to describe sound qualities at a low-scale level. Key-elements of this study protocol, including a questionnaire and the systematic audit of neighborhoods, were presented in this paper.;,citation_author=Elise. Kempen;,citation_author=Jeroen.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Determination of the Exterior Noise Environment by Statistical Assessment of Traffic Time History Patterns;,citation_abstract=Road traffic noise assessments require the consideration of noise indicators to accurately and reliably assess the prevailing exterior acoustic environment. At a minimum, these will include average noise indicators like equivalent sound level (Leq) and single event noise indicators like maximum sound level (Lmax). However, there is an absence of clear guidance in the United States of America (USA) as to how these indicators should be defined and measured so there is a clear link between the accuracy of the measurements and reliability of the data as presented. This paper offers a measurement strategy, specific to road traffic noise, capable of yielding statistically reliable estimates for Leq and Lmax. The proposed strategy is based upon statistical analyses of time history noise levels, recorded at various sites across Connecticut and California, in order to establish minimum reliable sampling times for each type of indicator. The study draws conclusions on appropriate estimates for Lmax based on a defined measurement period, as well as how reliable the Leq level over this time period is representative of a longer term level. Finally, an initial similarity study of diurnal profiles in USA and European cities is performed, providing a baseline assessment indicating whether data can be applied in general context throughout developed nations.;,citation_author=Eoin King;,citation_author=Robert Celmer;,citation_author=Sean Rahusen;,citation_author=Cameron Goodman;,citation_author=John LoVerde;,citation_author=Wayland Dong;,citation_author=Francesco Pilla;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_conference_title=New england NoiseCon-16: Revolution in noise control;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A comprehensive methodology for the multidimensional and synchronic data collecting in soundscape;,citation_abstract=The soundscape paradigm is comprised of complex living systems where individuals interact moment-by-moment among one another and with the physical environment. The real environments provide promising conditions to reveal deep soundscape behavior, including the multiple components involved and their interrelations as a whole. However, measuring and analyzing the numerous simultaneous variables of soundscape represents a challenge that is not completely understood. This work proposes and applies a comprehensive methodology for multidimensional and synchronic data collection in soundscape. The soundscape variables were organized into three main entities: experienced environment, acoustic environment, and extra-acoustic environment, containing, in turn, subgroups of variables called components. The variables contained in these components were acquired through synchronic field techniques that include surveys, acoustic measurements, audio recordings, photography, and video. The proposed methodology was tested, optimized, and applied in diverse open environments, including squares, parks, fountains, university campuses, streets, and pedestrian areas. The systematization of this comprehensive methodology provides a framework for soundscape research, a support for urban and environment management, and a preliminary procedure for standardization in soundscape data collecting.;,citation_author=Pablo Kogan;,citation_author=Bruno Turra;,citation_author=Jorge P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Green Soundscape Index (GSI): The potential of assessing the perceived balance between natural sound and traffic noise;,citation_abstract=Urban soundscapes are dynamic and complex multivariable environmental systems. Soundscapes can be organized into three main entities containing the multiple variables: Experienced Environment (EE), Acoustic Environment (AE), and Extra-Acoustic Environment (XE). This work applies a multidimensional and synchronic data-collecting methodology at eight urban environments in the city of Córdoba, Argentina. The EE was assessed by means of surveys, the AE by acoustic measurements and audio recordings, and the XE by photos, video, and complementary sources. In total, 39 measurement locations were considered, where data corresponding to 61 AE and 203 EE were collected. Multivariate analysis and GIS techniques were used for data processing. The types of sound sources perceived, and their extents make up part of the collected variables that belong to the EE, i.e. traffic, people, natural sounds, and others. Sources explaining most of the variance were traffic noise and natural sounds. Thus, a Green Soundscape Index (GSI) is defined here as the ratio of the perceived extents of natural sounds to traffic noise. Collected data were divided into three ranges according to GSI value: 1) perceptual predominance of traffic noise, 2) balanced perception, and 3) perceptual predominance of natural sounds. For each group, three additional variables from the EE and three from the AE were applied, which reported significant differences, especially between ranges 1 and 2 with 3. These results confirm the key role of perceiving natural sounds in a town environment and also support the proposal of a GSI as a valuable indicator to classify urban soundscapes. In addition, the collected GSI-related data significantly helps to assess the overall soundscape. It is noted that this proposed simple perceptual index not only allows one to assess and classify urban soundscapes but also contributes greatly toward a technique for separating environmental sound sources.;,citation_author=Pablo Kogan;,citation_author=Jorge P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acoustic scene generation with conditional sampleRNN;,citation_abstract=Acoustic scene generation (ASG) is a task to generate wave- forms for acoustic scenes. ASG can be used to generate audio scenes for movies and computer games. Recently, neural net- works such as SampleRNN have been used for speech and music generation. However, ASG is more challenging due to its wide variety. In addition, evaluating a generative model is also difficult. In this paper, we propose to use a conditional SampleRNN model to generate acoustic scenes conditioned on the input classes. We also propose objective criteria to evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated samples based on classification accuracy. The experiments on the DCASE 2016 Task 1 acoustic scene data show that with the generated audio samples, a classification accuracy of 65.5% can be achieved compared to samples generated by a random model of 6.7% and samples from real recording of 83.1%. The performance of a classifier trained only on generated samples achieves an accuracy of 51.3%, as opposed to an accuracy of 6.7% with samples generated by a random model.;,citation_author=Qiuqiang Kong;,citation_author=Yong Xu;,citation_author=Turab Iqbal;,citation_author=Yin Cao;,citation_author=Wenwu Wang;,citation_author=Mark D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The effects of activity-related contexts on individual sound exposures: A time-geographic approach to soundscape studies;,citation_abstract=Noise is an ever-growing problem in cities. Conventional noise mitigation approaches may not necessarily control noise pollution, since whether a sound is perceived as noise is largely influenced by its specific contexts. Based on an activity-centric framework, this study examines the effects of activity-related contexts and measured sound levels based on individuals’ sound evaluations as they undertake daily activities at different geographic locations and times. Data for the study were collected from 33 participants in Chicago (USA) using Global Positioning System-equipped mobile phones, portable sound sensors, and activity diaries. Multilevel logistic modeling was used to examine the relationships among measured sound levels, sound evaluations, and activity-related contexts for each recorded activity of the participants. The results indicate that activity-related contexts significantly influence individuals’ sound evaluations as they perform their daily activities. When activity-related contexts are taken into account, the measured sound levels that individuals experienced when performing an activity are no longer significant in influencing their sound evaluations. These results support the notion that sound is not only a physical feature but also a socio-psychological construct. It is crucial to adopt a human-centric and context-aware approach in urban planning through understanding the circumstances in which a sound is perceived as noise. Such an approach would help improve sound-related urban environments and construct livable and healthy cities.;,citation_author=Lirong Kou;,citation_author=Mei-Po Kwan;,citation_author=Yanwei Chai;,citation_publication_date=2020-10;,citation_cover_date=2020-10;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.1177/2399808320965243;,citation_journal_title=Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Context matters for image descriptions for accessibility: Challenges for referenceless evaluation metrics;,citation_abstract=Few images on the Web receive alt-text descriptions that would make them accessible to blind and low vision (BLV) users. Image-based NLG systems have progressed to the point where they can begin to address this persistent societal problem, but these systems will not be fully successful unless we evaluate them on metrics that guide their development correctly. Here, we argue against current referenceless metrics – those that don’t rely on human-generated ground-truth descriptions – on the grounds that they do not align with the needs of BLV users. The fundamental shortcoming of these metrics is that they do not take context into account, whereas contextual information is highly valued by BLV users. To substantiate these claims, we present a study with BLV participants who rated descriptions along a variety of dimensions. An in-depth analysis reveals that the lack of context-awareness makes current referenceless metrics inadequate for advancing image accessibility. As a proof-of-concept, we provide a contextual version of the referenceless metric CLIPScore which begins to address the disconnect to the BLV data.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acoustical, sensory, and psychological research data and procedures for their use in predicting effects of environmental noises;,citation_abstract=A demonstration field-research study reveals that aircraft noise measured at two one-story houses is approximately 9 dB less attenuated from measured outdoor levels than is street traffic noise, and, found in other studies, approximately 14 dB less than railway noise. Comparable differences are found between these noises from the application of basic acoustical formulas for quantifying attenuations that occur on site of one- and two-story houses. Reasonably consistent with those findings are results from attitude surveys showing that daily exposure levels of aircraft must be approximately 8 dB less than levels of street traffic noise, and approximately 13 dB less than levels of railway noise to be perceived as an equal cause of annoyance and related adverse effects. However, USA government guidelines recommend that equal exposure levels of noise measured outdoors from vehicles of transportation should be considered as being equally annoying. Changes in present USA noise-measurement procedures and noise-control guidelines are proposed that provide more accurate predictions of annoyance, related adverse effects, and criteria for setting &amp;amp;amp;quot;tolerable&amp;quot; limits of noise exposure in residential areas.

Noise Control Eng. 42, 25-30] curves present misleading research information regarding DENL/DENL levels of environmental noises from transportation vehicles and the impact of annoyance and associated adverse effects on people living in residential areas. The reasons are shown to be jointly due to (a) interpretations of early research data, (b) plotting of annoyance data for noise exposure from different types of transportation vehicles on a single set of coordinates, and (c) the assumption that the effective, as heard, levels of noise from different sources are proportional to day, night level (DNL)/day, evening night level (DENL) levels measured at a common-point outdoors. The subtraction of on-site attenuations from the measured outdoor levels of environmental noises used in the calculation of DNL/DENL provides new metrics, labeled EDNL/EDENL, for the calculation of the effective exposure levels of noises perceived as equaling annoying. Predictions of judged annoyance in residential areas from the noises of transportation vehicles are made with predicted errors of &amp;amp;amp;lt;1 dB EDNL/EDENL, compared to errors ranging from approximately 6 to approximately 14 dB by DNL/DENL.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Investigating the perception of soundscapes through acoustic scene simulation;,citation_abstract=This paper introduces a new experimental protocol for studying mental representations of urban soundscapes through a simulation process. Subjects are asked to create a full soundscape by means of a dedicated software tool, coupled with a structured sound data set. This paradigm is used to characterize urban sound environment representations by analyzing the sound classes that were used to simulate the auditory scenes. A rating experiment of the soundscape pleasantness using a seven-point bipolar semantic scale is conducted to further refine the analysis of the simulated urban acoustic scenes. Results show that (1) a semantic characterization in terms of presence/absence of sound sources is an effective way to characterize urban soundscape pleasantness, and (2) acoustic pressure levels computed for specific sound sources better characterize the appraisal than the acoustic pressure level computed over the overall soundscape.;,citation_author=G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cancellation of room reflections over an extended area using Ambisonics;,citation_abstract=This paper investigates the compensation of room reflections based on Ambisonics. A multichannel room equalization method for Ambisonic playback systems is proposed. The compensation filters are designed to operate in the spherical harmonics domain, prior to the decoding step. Their design requires the inversion of a matrix which can be ill-conditioned at low frequencies and for higher Ambisonic orders. A crossover and cross-order method is proposed to circumvent this problem and to reduce the amount of necessary regularization. Simulation results are presented in frequency, space, and temporal domains over a wide-range of frequencies. It is shown that the proposed method is efficient and can reduce the reproduction error to À14 dB in the reconstruction area defined in free field. Practical considerations such as Ambisonic room response estimation and robustness of the method are investigated. Experimental results are provided and show good agreement with the theory. Finally, a glimpse into the extension of the proposed method to create three-dimensional measurement-based Ambisonic reverberation is discussed.;,citation_author=Pierre Lecomte;,citation_author=Philippe-Aubert Gauthier;,citation_author=Christophe Langrenne;,citation_author=Alain Berry;,citation_author=Alexandre Garcia;,citation_publication_date=2018-07;,citation_cover_date=2018-07;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.5023326;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_volume=143;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">

A total of 20 university students were exposed to seven noise conditions. Laboratory experiments employed semantic and episodic memory tasks. Self-reports of perception were collected from the participants. It was found that multiple noise sources impaired the free recall of words, and free recall scores were affected by noise type. Significant differences in free recall scores were found when the noise level difference between the individual noise and multiple noise sources was more than 5 dB. In contrast, word comprehension did not mediate the effects of noise on semantic memory. Annoyance caused by multiple noise sources correlated highly with the results of the free recall and word comprehension tasks. Moreover, loudness and roughness were found to account for the annoyance ratings of combinations of road traffic noise with construction or ventilation noises.;,citation_author=Pyoung Jik Lee;,citation_author=Jin Yong Jeon;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://asa.scitation.org/toc/jas/134/4;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.4818776;,citation_volume=134;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">

The present study is aimed to understand attitude of people towards noise inside their homes in London during the lockdown. Tweets from the social media platform were collected during the lockdown and the same periods in 2019. Additionally, subjective responses to outdoor and neighbour noises were collected through a questionnaire survey. Tweets about noise complaints during the lockdown were more than twice of those before introduction of lockdown. A substantial increase in talking/shouting, and TV/music activities were observed among the neighbour noise sources. Similar findings were obtained from the survey. The respondents answered that the perceived outdoor noise level decreased but perceived neighbour noise level increased during the lockdown. The outdoor noise annoyance ratings were revealed to be significantly lower than those before the lockdown. In contrast, neighbour noises were more frequently heard and annoyance ratings increased compared to the pre-lockdown period. In particular, talking/shouting and TV/music were most annoying. Furthermore, neighbour noise was more annoying than outdoor noise during the lockdown. This suggests that neighbour noise is more problematic than outdoor noise during lockdown.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Informational factors in identifying environmental sounds in natural auditory scenes;,citation_abstract=In a non-linguistic analog of the &amp;amp;amp;quot;cocktail-party&amp;quot; scenario, informational and contextual factors were found to affect the recognition of everyday environmental sounds embedded in naturalistic auditory scenes. Short environmental sound targets were presented in a dichotic background scene composed of either a single stereo background scene or a composite background scene created by playing different background scenes to the different ears. The side of presentation, time of onset, and number of target sounds were varied across trials to increase the uncertainty for the participant. Half the sounds were contextually congruent with the background sound (i.e., consistent with the meaningful real-world sound environment represented in the auditory scene) and half were incongruent. The presence of a single competing background scene decreased identification accuracy, suggesting an informational masking effect. In tandem, there was a contextual pop-out effect, with contextually incongruent sounds identified more accurately. However, when targets were incongruent with the real-world context of the background scene, informational masking was reduced. Acoustic analyses suggested that this contextual pop-out effect was driven by a mixture of perceptual differences between the target and background, as well as by higher-level cognitive factors. These findings indicate that identification of environmental sounds in naturalistic backgrounds is an active process that requires integrating perceptual, attentional, and cognitive resources.;,citation_author=Robert Leech;,citation_author=Brian Gygi;,citation_author=Jennifer Aydelott;,citation_author=Frederic Dick;,citation_publication_date=2009;,citation_cover_date=2009;,citation_year=2009;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.3238160;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_pmid=20000928;,citation_volume=126;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">

However, due to the complex relationship between environmental noise and its perception by the citizens, it is not sufficient to quantitatively measure environmental noise. We need to collect and aggregate contextualized - both quantitative and qualitative - data about the urban environmental noise so as to be able to study the objective and subjective relationships between sound and living beings. This complex knowledge is a prerequisite for making efficient territorial publich policies for soundscapes that are inclined towards living beings welfare. In this paper, we investigate how Mobile Phone Sensing (MPS) - aka crowdsensing - enables the gathering of such knowledge, provided the implementation of sensing protocols that are customized according to the context of use and the intended exploitation of the data. Through three case studies that we carried out in France and Finland, we show that MPS is not solely a tool that contributes to sensitizing citizens and decision-makes avout noise pollution; it also contributes to increasing our knowledge about the impact of the environmental noise on people’s health and well-being in relation to its physical and subject perception.;,citation_author=Bruno Lefèvre;,citation_author=Rachit Agarwal;,citation_author=Valérie Issarny;,citation_author=Vivien Mallet;,citation_author=Bruno Lefèvre;,citation_author=Rachit Agarwal;,citation_author=Valérie Issarny;,citation_author=Vivien Mallet;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_journal_title=HAL archives-ouvertes;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Urban Environmental Quality: Perceptions and Measures;,citation_abstract=Urban environmental problems are driven by congestion (of people, industries, and vehicles). To some extent, these stressors can be assessed using metrics derived from analytical chemistry or land use/demographic planning. However, this analytic approach to describe environmental quality leaves out other, incommensurable dimensions of quality of life. For example, stress levels and chronic disease prevalence are, to a large extent, unmeasured. Furthermore, environmental risks result from the intersection of physical phenomena with social and economic vulnerability. This is illustrated using a case study involving the location of a major sanitary landfill next to a community. There is a need to combine traditional, quantitative metrics with other, more qualitative indicators. There is also a need for more integrative ways of describing environmental quality. Future research should provide more comprehensive, socioecological models for measuring quality of life and environmental stress in urban systems.;,citation_author=R. P.

Design, setting, participants: A cross sectional, multilevel design with neighbourhoods as the primary sampling unit and senior residents as the secondary unit. Five hundred and seventy seven residents (mean age = 74 years, SD = 6.3 years) participated in the survey, which was conducted among 56 city defined neighbourhoods in Portland, Oregon, USA. Neighbourhood level variables were constructed using geographical information systems. Resident level variables consisted of a mix of self reports and geocoded data on the built environment. Main outcome measure: Self reported neighbourhood walking. Main results: A positive relation was found between built environment factors (density of places of employment, household density, green and open spaces for recreation, number of street intersections) and walking activity at the neighbourhood level. At the resident level, perceptions of safety for walking and number of nearby recreational facilities were positively related to high levels of walking activity. A significant interaction was observed between number of street intersections and perceptions of safety from traffic. Conclusions: Certain neighbourhood built environment characteristics related to urban form were positively associated with walking activity in the neighbourhoods of senior residents.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Environmental Sounds Influence the Multisensory Perception of Chocolate Gelati;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Recently, it has been shown that various auditory stimuli modulate flavour perception. The present study attempts to understand the effects of environmental sounds (park, food court, fast food restaurant, cafe, and bar sounds) on the perception of chocolate gelato (specifically, sweet, bitter, milky, creamy, cocoa, roasted, and vanilla notes) using the Temporal Check-All-That-Apply (TCATA) method. Additionally, affective ratings of the auditory stimuli were obtained using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) in terms of their valence, arousal, and dominance. In total, 58 panellists rated the sounds and chocolate gelato in a sensory laboratory. The results revealed that bitterness, roasted, and cocoa notes were more evident when the bar, fast food, and food court sounds were played. Meanwhile, sweetness was cited more in the early mastication period when listening to park and café sounds. The park sound was significantly higher in valence, while the bar sound was significantly higher in arousal. Dominance was significantly higher for the fast food restaurant, food court, and bar sound conditions. Intriguingly, the valence evoked by the pleasant park sound was positively correlated with the sweetness of the gelato. Meanwhile, the arousal associated with bar sounds was positively correlated with bitterness, roasted, and cocoa attributes. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that people’s perception of the flavour of gelato varied with the different real-world sounds used in this study.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;;,citation_author=undefined Lin;,citation_author=undefined Hamid;,citation_author=undefined Shepherd;,citation_author=undefined Kantono;,citation_author=undefined Spence;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/8/4/124;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.3390/foods8040124;,citation_issn=2304-8158;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Foods;">

Material and methods: Poisson Regression Models were used to quantify the associations. Meteorological variables, influenza epidemics, pollen concentrations and trends and periodicities were used as controlling variables. Results: The main results obtained were the detected relationship (p &amp;amp;amp;lt;0.05) between emergency hospital admissions due to organic diseases and noise levels (AR=2.4%) and for PM10concentrations (AR=2.1%). For respiratory diseases statistically significant associations were detected for noise levels (AR=4.7%) and cold temperatures (AR=3.8%). The main association detected for causes of admissions due to bronchitis was for O3(AR=36.8%) and for pneumonia was for noise levels (AR=7.7%). Conclusion: The results obtained suggest that noise level particularly is a risk factor for daily emergency hospital admissions for organic and respiratory diseases in children less than 10 years old in Madrid.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A taxonomy of sound sources in restaurants;,citation_abstract=Restaurants are complex environments engaging all our senses. More or less designable sound sources, such as background music, voices, and kitchen noises, influence the overall perception of the soundscape. Previous research suggested typologies of sounds in some environmental contexts, such as urban parks and offices, but there is no detailed account that is relevant to restaurants. We collected on-site data in 40 restaurants (n = 393), including perceptual ratings, free-form annotations of characteristic sounds and whether they were liked or not, and free-form descriptive words for the environment as a whole. The annotations were subjected to cladistic analysis, yielding a multi-level taxonomy of perceived sound sources in restaurants (SSR) with good construct validity and external robustness. Further analysis revealed that voice-related characteristic sounds including a ’people’ specifier were more liked than those without it (d = 0.14 SD), possibly due to an emotional crossmodal association mechanism. Liking of characteristic sounds differed between the first and last annotations that respondents made (d = 0.21 SD), which might be due to an initially positive bias being countered by exposure to a task inducing a mode of critical listening. Comparing the SSR taxonomy with previous classifications, we believe it will prove useful for field research, simulation design, and sound perception theory.;,citation_author=Per Magnus Lindborg;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2016.03.032;,citation_issn=1872-910X;,citation_volume=110;,citation_journal_title=Applied Acoustics;,citation_publisher=Elsevier Ltd;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A systematic review of prediction models for the experience of urban soundscapes;,citation_abstract=A systematic review for soundscape modelling methods is presented. The methods for developing soundscape models are hereby questioned by investigating the following aspects: data acquisition methods, indicators used as predictors of descriptors in the models, descriptors targeted as output of the models, linear rather than non-linear model fitting, and overall performances. The inclusion criteria for the reviewed studies were: models dealing with soundscape dimensions aligned with the definitions provided in the ISO 12913 series; models based on soundscape data sampled at least at two different locations and using at least two variables as indicators. The Scopus database was queried. Biases on papers selection were considered and those related to the methods are discussed in the current study. Out of 256 results from Scopus, 22 studies were selected. Two studies were included from the references among the results. The data extraction from the 24 studies includes: data collection methods, input and output for the models, and model performance. Three main data collection methods were found. Several studies focus on the different combination of indicators among physical measurements, perceptual evaluations, temporal dynamics, demographic and psychological information, context information and visual amenity. The descriptors considered across the studies include: acoustic comfort, valence, arousal, calmness, chaoticness, sound quality, tranquillity, and vibrancy. The interpretation of the results is limited by the large variety of methods, and the large number of parameters in spite of a limited amount of studies obtained from the query. However, perceptual indicators, visual and contextual indicators, as well as time dynamic embedding, overall provide a better prediction of soundscape. Finally, although the compared performance between linear and non-linear methods does not show remarkable differences, non-linear methods might still represent a more suitable choice in models where complex structures of indicators are used.;,citation_author=Matteo Lionello;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_publication_date=2020-06;,citation_cover_date=2020-06;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003682X20305831;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2020.107479;,citation_issn=0003-682X;,citation_volume=170;,citation_journal_title=Applied Acoustics;,citation_publisher=Elsevier BV;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Introducing a Method for Intervals Correction on Multiple Likert Scales: A Case Study on an Urban Soundscape Data Collection Instrument;,citation_abstract=Likert scales are useful for collecting data on attitudes and perceptions from large samples of people. In particular, they have become a well-established tool in soundscape studies for conducting in situ surveys to determine how people experience urban public spaces. However, it is still unclear whether the metrics of the scales are consistently interpreted during a typical assessment task. The current work aims at identifying some general trends in the interpretation of Likert scale metrics and introducing a procedure for the derivation of metric corrections by analyzing a case study dataset of 984 soundscape assessments across 11 urban locations in London. According to ISO/TS 12913-2:2018, soundscapes can be assessed through the scaling of 8 dimensions: pleasant, annoying, vibrant, monotonous, eventful, uneventful, calm, and chaotic. The hypothesis underlying this study is that a link exists between correlations across the percentage of assessments falling in each Likert scale category and a dilation/compression factor affecting the interpretation of the scales metric. The outcome of this metric correction value derivation is introduced for soundscape, and a new projection of the London soundscapes according to the corrected circumplex space is compared with the initial ISO circumplex space. The overall results show a general non-equidistant interpretation of the scales, particularly on the vibrant-monotonous direction. The implications of this correction have been demonstrated through a Linear Ridge Classifier task for predicting the London soundscape responses using objective acoustic parameters, which shows significant improvement when applied to the corrected data. The results suggest that the corrected values account for the non-equidistant interpretation of the Likert metrics, thereby allowing mathematical operations to be viable when applied to the data.;,citation_author=Matteo Lionello;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Andrew Mitchell;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_publication_date=2021;,citation_cover_date=2021;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2020.602831;,citation_issn=1664-1078;,citation_volume=11;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychology;">

The sound source localization algorithm based on the analysis of multichannel signals from the Acoustic Vector Sensor is presented. The methods are evaluated in an experiment conducted in the anechoic chamber, in which the representative events are played together with noise of differing intensity. The results of detection, classification and localization accuracy with respect to the Signal to Noise Ratio are discussed. The results show that the recognition and localization accuracy are strongly dependent on the acoustic conditions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Defining vehicular noise levels to manage risk associated with exterior facade design;,citation_abstract=Evaluation and mitigation of noise from vehicular sources is common as a building design criterion. In the United States of America (USA), it has been part of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) multifamily building design requirements since the 1970s. It is included in numerous state and local planning requirements, and also has recently been added to various Green Building Design Standards, including school and healthcare facility design guidelines. In California, the building codes include mitigation of traffic noise sources for all multifamily and most commercial projects. These criteria specify an allowable noise level, but do not provide a method for defining this level given the statistical variations. For sources with large variations, the method of defining the level can greatly affect the building façade design and the occupant experience. Further, it may be necessary to determine this level from relatively brief measurements. This paper examines the factors that should be considered when defining the exterior noise from vehicular sources. Methods for predicting the noise level using data are evaluated, and minimum survey requirements to determine specific exterior noise parameters are suggested.;,citation_author=John Loverde;,citation_author=Wayland Dong;,citation_author=Samantha Rawlings;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;">

In addition to the restorative effects of visual environments, recent research has shown increased interest in restorative soundscapes. The aim of this study is to examine whether a soundscape element perceived as pleasant has restorative effects in a simulated open-plan office. Subjects (N = 75) were recruited to participate in three experiments under different conditions: (a) different sound types, (b) different sound sequences, and (c) different audio-visual conditions. To measure stress recovery and fatigue mitigation, seven indicators representing participants’ physiological responses, psychological experience and cognitive performance were used. The results showed that the soundscape elements that were perceived as pleasant had an apparent positive effect on tiredness restoration and annoyance reduction. Interestingly, sound elements had a greater effect on psychological restoration compared with visual scenes under the simulated conditions of an open-plan office. Furthermore, it was shown that continuous sound did not have better restorative effects than intermittent sound. These findings revealed the restorative potential of a good soundscape and might provide some practical guidance on how to create a restorative environment in open-plan offices.;,citation_author=Hui Ma;,citation_author=Shan Shu;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/dav/aaua/2018/00000104/00000001/art00013;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.3813/AAA.919150;,citation_volume=104;,citation_journal_title=Acta Acustica united with Acustica;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Speech Identification and Comprehension in the Urban Soundscape;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Urban environments are characterised by the presence of copious and unstructured noise. This noise continuously challenges speech intelligibility both in normal-hearing and hearing-impaired individuals. In this paper, we investigate the impact of urban noise, such as traffic, on speech identification and, more generally, speech understanding. With this purpose, we perform listening experiments to evaluate the ability of individuals with normal hearing to detect words and interpret conversational speech in the presence of urban noise (e.g., street drilling, traffic jams). Our experiments confirm previous findings in different acoustic environments and demonstrate that speech identification is influenced by the similarity between the target speech and the masking noise also in urban scenarios. More specifically, we propose the use of the structural similarity index to quantify this similarity. Our analysis confirms that speech identification is more successful in presence of noise with tempo-spectral characteristics different from speech. Moreover, our results show that speech comprehension is not as challenging as word identification in urban sound environments that are characterised by the presence of severe noise. Indeed, our experiments demonstrate that speech comprehension can be fairly successful even in acoustic scenes where the ability to identify speech is highly reduced.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;;,citation_author=Letizia Marchegiani;,citation_author=Xenofon Fafoutis;,citation_author=Sahar Abbaspour;,citation_publication_date=2018-05;,citation_cover_date=2018-05;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/5/5/56;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.3390/environments5050056;,citation_issn=2076-3298;,citation_volume=5;,citation_journal_title=Environments;,citation_publisher=MDPI AG;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The effect of fundamental frequency on the brightness dimension of timbre;,citation_abstract=The dependency of the brightness dimension of timbre on fundamental frequency (FO) was examined experimentally. Subjects compared the timbres of 24 synthetic stimuli, produced by the combination of six values of spectral centroid to obtain different values of expected brightness, and four FO’s, ranging over 18 semitones. Subjects were instructed to ignore pitch differences. Dissimilarity scores were analyzed by both ANOVA and multidimensional scaling (MDS). Results show that timbres can be compared between stimuli with different FO’s over the range tested, and that differences in FO affect timbre dissimilarity in two ways. First, dissimilarity scores reveal a term proportional to FO difference that shows up in the MDS solution as a dimension correlated with FO and orthogonal to other timbre dimensions. Second, FO affects systematically the timbre dimension (brightness) correlated with spectral centroid. Interestingly, both terms covaried with differences in FO rather than chroma or consonance. The first term probably corresponds to pitch. The second can be eliminated if the formula for spectral centroid is modified by introducing a corrective factor dependent on FO.;,citation_author=Jeremy Marozeau;,citation_author=Alain Cheveigné;,citation_publication_date=2007-07;,citation_cover_date=2007-07;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.2384910;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_pmid=17297793;,citation_volume=121;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sound event envelope estimation in polyphonic mixtures;,citation_abstract=Sound event detection is the task of identifying automatically the presence and temporal boundaries of sound events within an input audio stream. In the last years, deep learning meth- ods have established themselves as the state-of-the-art ap- proach for the task, using binary indicators during training to denote whether an event is active or inactive. However, such binary activity indicators do not fully describe the events, and estimating the envelope of the sounds could provide more precise modeling of their activity. This paper proposes to es- timate the amplitude envelopes of target sound event classes in polyphonic mixtures. For training, we use the amplitude envelopes of the target sounds, calculated from mixture sig- nals and, for comparison, from their isolated counterparts. The model is then used to perform envelope estimation and sound event detection. Results show that the envelope es- timation allows good modeling of the sounds activity, with detection results comparable to current state-of-the art.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Principles of effective data visualization;,citation_abstract=Summary We live in a contemporary society surrounded by visuals, which, along with software options and electronic distribution, has created an increased importance on effective scientific visuals. Unfortunately, across scientific disciplines, many figures incorrectly present information or, when not incorrect, still use suboptimal data visualization practices. Presented here are ten principles that serve as guidance for authors who seek to improve their visual message. Some principles are less technical, such as determining the message before starting the visual, while other principles are more technical, such as how different color combinations imply different information. Because figure making is often not formally taught and figure standards are not readily enforced in science, it is incumbent upon scientists to be aware of best practices in order to most effectively tell the story of their data.;,citation_author=Stephen R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acoustic Quality and Health in Urban Environments – The SALVE Project;,citation_abstract=Background sounds of urban regions have been a concern of architecture and construction engineering for years. In the context of health research however, sound has been restricted to the health risk factor noise, thus reduced to sound decibel levels. Accordingly, noise mitigation measures aim exclusively at the reduction of noise level below a certain threshold. Soundscapes on the other hand, comprise all acoustic events of the natural, physical and human environment, which are determined by sound level, frequency, time and space. Soundscape Ecology which includes the study of spatio-temporal heterogeneity of sounds in different landscapes, provides a suitable methodical approach to analyse the relationships between soundscapes, the built environment and human health. This paper presents SALVE (Acoustic Quality and Health in Urban Environments), a two year interdisciplinary pilot project that started in October 2018 and involves the disciplines of public health and spatial planning. The project aims at the identification of criteria for health-promoting soundscapes in cities. By making year long direct and automated auditory measurements of a robust landuse sample in the city of Bochum, located in the highly urbanized Ruhr Area of Germany, one of the largest multi-seasonal urban soundscape datasets will be generated. These data will be merged with health data from the longitudinal, population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) study. Spatio-statistical models will be further developed to analyse health effects of different types of soundscapes in urban neighborhoods. The project serves as a starting point for an innovative and comprehensive approach to understanding the effects of sound quality on urban public health beyond noise protection. Additionally, knowledge will be gained for the development of solution based health-promoting strategies in spatial planning.;,citation_author=Susanne Moebus;,citation_author=Robynne Sutcliffe;,citation_author=Bryce Lawrence;,citation_author=Salman Ahmed;,citation_author=Timo Haselhoff;,citation_author=Dietwald Gruehn;,citation_editor=M.

This study examines soundscape-quality protocols in Japanese from several viewpoints. Findings are as follows: (1) the SSQP scales cannot be fully translated into Japanese without modifications; (2) pleasantness and eventfulness emerge as fundamental components in many situations; and (3) when assessing soundscape qualities, the meanings of some adjectives in the scales vary according to context.;,citation_author=Koji Nagahata;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_isbn=9788487985317;,citation_conference_title=INTER-NOISE 2019 MADRID - 48th international congress and exhibition on noise control engineering;">

The aim is to investigate if associations can be made between the dynamic relation between static sound sources and listener in public space and the perceived soundscape dimensions. An index for measuring spatial variability of sound sources in an urban acoustic environment is proposed to describe physical features of the investigated phenomena and help to predict its influence on the perceptual outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Context-dependent environmental sound monitoring using SOM coupled with LEGION;,citation_abstract=Environmental sound measurement networks are increasingly applied for monitoring noise pollution in an urban context. Intelligent measurement nodes offer the opportunity to perform advanced analysis of environmental sound, but trade- offs between cost and functionality still have to be made. When using a tiered architecture, local nodes with limited computing capabilities can be used to detect sound events of potential interest, which are then further analyzed by more powerful nodes. This paper presents a human-mimicking model for detecting rare and conspicuous sound events. Features encoding spectro-temporal irregularities are extracted from the sound, and a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is used to identify co- occurring features, which most likely belong to a single sound object. Extensive training allows this map to be tuned to the typical sounds that are heard at the microphone location. A Locally Excitatory Globally Inhibitory Oscillator Network (LEGION) is used to group units of the SOM in order to construct distinct sound objects.;,citation_author=Damiano Oldoni;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Michaël Rademaker;,citation_author=Bernard De Baets;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_publication_date=2010-07;,citation_cover_date=2010-07;,citation_year=2010;,citation_doi=10.1109/ijcnn.2010.5596977;,citation_isbn=9781424481262;,citation_conference_title=The 2010 international joint conference on neural networks (IJCNN);,citation_conference=IEEE;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A computational model of auditory attention for use in soundscape research;,citation_abstract=Urban soundscape design involves creating outdoor spaces that are pleasing to the ear. One way to achieve this goal is to add or accentuate sounds that are considered to be desired by most users of the space, such that the desired sounds mask undesired sounds, or at least distract attention away from undesired sounds. In view of removing the need for a listening panel to assess the effective-ness of such soundscape measures, the interest for new models and techniques is growing. In this paper, a model of auditory attention to environmental sound is presented, which balances computa-tional complexity and biological plausibility. Once the model is trained for a particular location, it classifies the sounds that are present in the soundscape and simulates how a typical listener would switch attention over time between different sounds. The model provides an acoustic summary, giv-ing the soundscape designer a quick overview of the typical sounds at a particular location, and allows assessment of the perceptual effect of introducing additional sounds.;,citation_author=Damiano Oldoni;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Michiel Boes;,citation_author=Michaël Rademaker;,citation_author=Bernard De Baets;,citation_author=Timothy Van Renterghem;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.4807798;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_pmid=23862891;,citation_volume=134;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The acoustic summary as a tool for representing urban sound environments;,citation_abstract=Detecting and selecting sound events is emerging as an interesting technique for characterizing and representing the sound environment of a specific location. In this article we propose a computational model for automatically constructing a so-called acoustic summary, i.e. a comprehensive collection of sounds aiming to represent the specific sound environment at a given location. Such an acoustic summary could be used by architects, soundscape designers, and urban planners to explore - by listening - the sonic environment at a certain location as it is perceived by a human listener. The model is based on a self-organizing map, a type of neural network. It starts by extracting several psychoacoustic features from the sound. A specific, extensive and unsupervised training allows this map to be tuned to the typical sounds that are likely to be heard at the microphone location. The learning algorithm takes into account some basic aspects of human perception. For example, salient events tend to be better remembered than the ones that do not stand out, even if they occur less frequently. After the training, the self-organizing map is used to form an exhaustive acoustic summary by means of automatically recording specific sound events for the microphone location. In addition to describing the proposed tool, this paper also presents a validation test with local residents in order to show the ability of the model to pick up sounds which bring out the distinctiveness and the specificity of the soundscape as a local resident would do.;,citation_author=Damiano Oldoni;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Annelies Bockstael;,citation_author=Michiel Boes;,citation_author=Bernard De Baets;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.08.013;,citation_issn=0169-2046;,citation_volume=144;,citation_journal_title=Landscape and Urban Planning;,citation_publisher=Elsevier B.V.;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A deep learning approach for modelling perceptual attributes of soundscapes;,citation_abstract=Determining the soundscape quality of a location is typically labor-intensive, since actual volunteers must be recruited to make the subjective evaluations. To reduce the reliance on subjective evaluations, psychoacoustic parameters and objective measurements of the acoustic environment have traditionally been used to model perceptual attributes of soundscapes and predict soundscape quality. However, existing models tend to generalize sub-optimally and neglect the listener context in the definition of a soundscape according to ISO/TS 12913-1:2014. Deep neural network (DNN) architectures with spectrogram-based inputs have recently been shown to be highly generalizable to a variety of audio detection and classification problems, and can easily be modified to accept multi-modal inputs. Hence, we hypothesize that DNNs can be robust predictive models for soundscapes that account for both the acoustic environment and listener context, and we present a preliminary study of this with bird songs as acoustic stimuli. Participants rated the stimuli based on their pleasantness and eventfulness, and a DNN was then trained to predict the ratings a participant gave a particular soundscape, given the acoustic environment and demographic information of the participant. The DNN performance was finally evaluated based on standard metrics.;,citation_author=Kenneth Ooi;,citation_author=Jooyoung Hong;,citation_author=Bhan Lam;,citation_author=Zhen Ting Ong;,citation_author=Woon-Seng Gan;,citation_publication_date=2020-08;,citation_cover_date=2020-08;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344609366_A_deep_learning_approach_for_modelling_perceptual_attributes_of_soundscapes;,citation_conference_title=INTER-NOISE 2020;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A benchmark comparison of perceptual models for soundscapes on a large-scale augmented soundscape dataset;,citation_abstract=Psychoacoustic indicators and spectrogram-based features are standard inputs for the development of prediction models for the perception and analysis of soundscapes. However, existing models in the soundscape literature are trained on different collections of input parameters and frequently mutually exclusive datasets, which complicates fair comparisons of model performance and generalizability to unseen data and sound-scapes. Hence, we use a large-scale, publicly-available dataset of 25,440 responses to unique augmented soundscapes as a common benchmark for comparison of the relative performance of a selection of input and model types used in previous soundscape studies, as well as deep neural network architectures commonly used for other acoustic tasks. The dataset is separated into a 5-fold cross-validation set of 25,200 responses and an independent test set of 240 responses to facilitate unbiased comparisons. We trained models to predict ratings given by participants as responses to the augmented soundscapes, on perceptual attribute scales defined and derived from the ISO/TS 12913-3 circumplex model (i.e., pleasantness and eventfulness). Subsequently , we evaluate their performance as classification models for the classification of soundscapes into the quadrants generated by the Pleasantness-Eventfulness axes of the ISO/TS 12913-3 circumplex model, and as regression models for the prediction of individual responses to soundscapes.;,citation_author=Kenneth Ooi;,citation_author=Karn Watcharasupat;,citation_author=Bhan Lam;,citation_author=Zhen Ting Ong;,citation_author=Woon-Seng Gan;,citation_publication_date=2022-10;,citation_cover_date=2022-10;,citation_year=2022;">

These models are then combined in a methodological and analytical framework to study listeners’ relationships to contemporary urban environments. The methodology is applied to a case study - the soundscape of Commercial Drive in Vancouver BC, Canada - in order to explore the various models and provide a practical analysis of the soundscape of Commercial Drive. The methodology used consists of a series of interviews that proceed from the general to the specific, and finally move back to a macro analysis of the soundscape. First, short surveys and &amp;amp;amp;quot;sonic mind maps&amp;quot; were conducted with people chosen randomly on the street. Then, recorded interviews with long-term inhabitants procvided more specific information about potential locations to study and various themes of inquiry. Three contrasting locations were selected and recorded, and these recording were used in &quot;reactivated listening sessions&quot; with participants who possess a particular aural knowledge. These subjective accounts and other quantitative information gathered throughout the are analysed based on a communicational approach to the soundscape and with the help of Amphoux’s qualitatitve criteria. The results of the case study suggest the presence of a strong acoustic community maintained through active outdoor soundmaking practices, the omnipresence of non-mediated, vocal interactions, and a blurring of traditional indoor/private and outdoor/public boundaries. The study has also helped in demonstrating hour Amphoux’s qualitative critera can be used in the context of an acoustic communicational inquiry of the sound environment.;,citation_author=David Paquette;,citation_publication_date=2002;,citation_cover_date=2002;,citation_year=2002;,citation_dissertation_institution=Simon Fraser University;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sound Landscapes: The Past, the Present and the Possible;,citation_abstract=Sound Landscapes poses the question, how can polyphonic soundscape ideals be the main driver in the design of post-industrial environments? A hypothetical Master Plan for future development at Onehunga is used as a framework to answer this question. The plan provides a location for the implementation of underestimated acoustic techniques, which will add to the discourse regarding harmonious soundscapes within the urban landscape. The discourse currently focuses predominately on the undesirable influences of the imbalanced soundscape that is universally known as noise pollution. This investigation seeks to address this issue and demonstrate that the sonic landscape is a valuable resource awaiting its discovery and that there are opportunities for this invisible aesthetic to foster and enrich a sense of place. Polyphonic elements can occupy a privileged niche within the landscape. Significant social, cultural and ecological needs of key stakeholders have been identified and these are acknowledged and reflected in the sound-driven principles and interventions that are a result of this project. Analysis of design precedents has identified possibilities for addressing issues of noise pollution from a position of inspiration and positive influence. It is common for disciplines to reside in silos. This research project seeks to raise awareness of the potentials of integation - the confluence of acoustic theory and normative landscape architectural practice. This process, which is polyphonic by nature, has produced a variety of strategies and spatial arrangements that aim to transform sound from a problem to a desig resource.;,citation_author=Jane Park;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/0507464v2;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.10.018;,citation_issn=0960-9822;,citation_pmid=26549260;,citation_dissertation_institution=Unitec Institute of Technology, New Zealand;">

This paper continues the validation process of a previously developed Perceived Restorativeness Soundscape Scale (PRSS). The study takes a novel methodological approach to explore the PRSS face and construct validity by examining the qualitative reasons for participants’ numerical responses to the PRSS items. The structure and framing of items are first examined, to produce 44 items which are assessed on a seven-point Likert agreement scale, followed by a free format justification. Ten English speaking participants completed the PRSS interpretation questionnaire in two cafes in Montréal, Canada. Interpretation of participant free format responses led to six themes, which related to either the individual (personal attributes, personal outcomes), the environment (physical environment attributes, soundscape design) or an interaction of the two (behavior setting, normality, and typicality). The themes are discussed in relation to each Attention Restoration Theory (ART) component, namely Fascination, Being-Away, Compatibility, and Extent. The paper concludes by discussing the face and construct validity of the PRSS, as well as the wider methodological and theoretical implications for soundscape and attention restoration research, including the terminology importance in items measuring ART components and the value of all four components in assessing perceived restorativeness.;,citation_author=Sarah R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Timbre Toolbox: Extracting audio descriptors from musical signals;,citation_abstract=The analysis of musical signals to extract audio descriptors that can potentially characterize their timbre has been disparate and often too focused on a particular small set of sounds. The Timbre Toolbox provides a comprehensive set of descriptors that can be useful in perceptual research, as well as in music information retrieval and machine-learning approaches to content-based retrieval in large sound databases. Sound events are first analyzed in terms of various input representations (short-term Fourier transform, harmonic sinusoidal components, an auditory model based on the equivalent rectangular bandwidth concept, the energy envelope). A large number of audio descriptors are then derived from each of these representations to capture temporal, spectral, spectrotemporal, and energetic properties of the sound events. Some descriptors are global, providing a single value for the whole sound event, whereas others are time-varying. Robust descriptive statistics are used to characterize the time-varying descriptors. To examine the information redundancy across audio descriptors, correlational analysis followed by hierarchical clustering is performed. This analysis suggests ten classes of relatively independent audio descriptors, showing that the Timbre Toolbox is a multidimensional instrument for the measurement of the acoustical structure of complex sound signals.;,citation_author=Geoffroy Peeters;,citation_author=Bruno L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundscape assessment of a monumental place: A methodology based on the perception of dominant sounds;,citation_abstract=Some monumental sites have unique soundscapes that deserve to be managed not only by their tourist and cultural value, but also for enhancing the visitors’ overall impression. These sites can include a multitude of sound sources within a variety of different locations with geometrically different spaces in size and shape, so that the soundscape assessment could be quite challenging. The hypothesis of this study is that regardless of the complexity of sound sources comprising a given acoustic environment, the perceived soundscape quality is driven primarily by the evaluation of the subjectively dominant sounds. This hypothesis was tested in a field study conducted in a monumental site with historical relevance located in a semi-natural environment (the Alhambra of Granada, Spain). The main finding was that, for a given location, the higher the percentage of visitors reporting a pleasant sound as dominant, the higher the reported soundscape quality and overall impression. Moreover, it was found that: (i) the sounds of birds, water and visitors (voices and footsteps) are the sounds primarily reported as dominant, (ii) the throngs of visitors (human sounds) negatively affect the soundscape quality, (iii) natural sounds increase the reported pleasantness, especially water sounds, which significantly improve the perceived soundscape quality. The practical implication is that, with appropriate information on subjectively dominant sound sources to prioritize corrective actions, soundscape management and its enhancement will require much less time and operational effort than other options for soundscape assessment based on the use of extensive questionnaires.;,citation_author=Germán Pérez-Martínez;,citation_author=Antonio J.

This acoustic surface was designed to create specific sonic effects. The design was simulated using custom integrated acoustic software and also using Odeon acoustic analysis software. The research demonstrates a method for designing space- and sound-defining surfaces, defines the concept of acoustic subspace, and suggests some new parameters for defining acoustic subspaces.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The importance of auditory-visual interaction in the construction of ’tranquil space’;,citation_abstract=n a world of sensory overload, it is becoming increasingly important to provide environments that enable us to recover our sense of well being. Such restorative (’tranquil’) environments need to comprise sufficient sensory stimulation to keep us engaged, whilst at the same time providing opportunity for reflection and relaxation. One essential aspect in safeguarding existing, or developing new ’tranquil space’, is understanding the optimum relationship between the soundscape and the visual composition of a location. This research represents a first step in understanding the effects of audio-visual interaction on the perception of tranquillity and identifies how the interpretation of acoustic information is an integral part of this process. By using uni and bi-modal auditory-visual stimuli in a two stage experimental strategy, it has been possible to measure the key components of the tranquillity construct. The findings of this work should be of particular interest to those charged with landscape management, such as National Park Authorities, Regional Councils, and other agencies concerned with providing and maintaining public amenity.;,citation_author=Robert J.

The scale of urban perception studies until recently was considerably constrained by the limited number of study participants. We here present a crowdsourcing project that aims to investigate, at scale, which visual aspects of London neighborhoods make them appear beautiful, quiet, and/or happy. We collect votes from over 3.3K individuals and translate them into quantitative measures of urban perception. In so doing, we quantify each neighborhood’s aesthetic capital. By then using state-of-the-art image processing techniques, we determine visual cues that may cause a street to be perceived as being beautiful, quiet, or happy. We identify effects of color, texture and visual words. For example, the amount of greenery is the most positively associated visual cue with each of three qualities; by contrast, broad streets, fortress-like buildings, and council houses tend to be associated with the opposite qualities (ugly, noisy, and unhappy).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting the Perceived Restorative Potential of Bird Sounds Through Acoustics and Aesthetics;,citation_abstract=Some, but not all, bird sounds are associated with perceptions of restoration from stress and cognitive fatigue. The perceptual properties that might underpin these differences are understudied. In this online study, ratings of perceived restorative potential (PRP) and aesthetic properties of 50 bird sounds were provided by 174 residents of the United Kingdom. These were merged with data on objectively measured acoustic properties of the sounds. Regression analyses demonstrated that sound level, harmonics, and frequency, and perceptions of complexity, familiarity, and pattern, were significant predictors of PRP and cognitive and affective appraisals of bird sounds. These findings shed light on the structural and perceptual properties that may influence restorative potential of acoustic natural stimuli. Finally, through their potential associations with meaning, these findings highlight the importance of further study of semantic or meaning-based properties within the restorative environments literature.;,citation_author=Eleanor Ratcliffe;,citation_author=Birgitta Gatersleben;,citation_author=Paul T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Correlation between objective and subjective assessment of noise barriers;,citation_abstract=There are several international standards that define the way to evaluate the attenuation capacity of noise reducing devices, by single-number quantities representing airborne sound insulation and insertion loss. These two single-value ratings define the quality and performance of acoustic barriers, the former being related to intrinsic and the latter to both intrinsic and extrinsic acoustic characteristics of the devices. However, not many studies can be found on whether these objective parameters correlate to the perception of annoyance reduction. The aim of the present work is to analyze the adequacy of these objective ratings to indicate the performance of noise barriers, by comparing their values with the perception of annoyance reduction. For this purpose, ninety individuals of two different nationalities (Spanish and Portuguese) were asked to rate the perceived annoyance reduction in a listening experimental test, in which they were exposed, under controlled conditions, to several environmental noises and acoustic screened stimuli simulated by audio filters. The obtained results show a high correlation between objective ratings and subjective annoyance perception, with a better correlation being observed for insertion loss single-number parameter than for the airborne sound insulation single-number rating. Furthermore, significant differences were found depending on the gender and nationality of the respondents. The results, from this ongoing research work, may be of great interest for future acoustic barriers design.;,citation_author=J. Redondo;,citation_author=M. P. Peiró-Torres;,citation_author=C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Relationships among satisfaction, noise perception, and use of urban green spaces;,citation_abstract=Nowadays, urban design without green spaces is inconceivable. Environmental, social, and economic benefits generated by green spaces are essential to maintain the health and quality of life of the population and to control pollution. Therefore, urban planners and city leaders should know the interactions between the features of green spaces, the sociodemographic characteristics of users, and the type of use. In addition, in some studies, noise was found to be an essential factor in the perception of these green spaces. For this purpose, surveys and sound measurements were carried out simultaneously in different locations of the main green spaces of Cáceres city. The results of this study show that noise satisfaction has the greatest significant relationship with overall satisfaction with green spaces. Different features, including satisfaction with the absence of noise, can explain 71.4% of the overall satisfaction. Road traffic is the most annoying sound source, but the degree of noise annoyance is lower than that estimated for other urban environments with similar sound levels. Walking and talking activities, emotions of fear and irritability, and interruptions to conversation are most often affected by noise in these urban environments. Another conclusion obtained is that the highest significant correlation coefficients are between noise perception by users and both the equivalent continuous linear weighted sound level and sharpness. Lastly, the green-space use determines differences and significant relationships with the sociodemographic characteristics. Also, the places in green spaces where people frequently perform walking and relaxation activities have the lowest sound levels. Therefore, noise is a statistically relevant factor to be considered in the design of green spaces.;,citation_author=Guillermo Rey Gozalo;,citation_author=Juan Miguel Barrigón Morillas;,citation_author=David Montes González;,citation_author=Pedro Atanasio Moraga;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.148;,citation_issn=1879-1026;,citation_volume=624;,citation_journal_title=Science of the Total Environment;,citation_publisher=Elsevier B.V.;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sound quality indicators for urban places in Paris cross-validated by Milan data;,citation_abstract=A specific smartphone application was developed to collect perceptive and acoustic data in Paris. About 3400 questionnaires were analyzed, regarding the global sound environment characterization, the perceived loudness of some emergent sources and the presence time ratio of sources that do not emerge from the background. Sound pressure level was recorded each second from the mobile phone’s microphone during a 10-min period. The aim of this study is to propose indicators of urban sound quality based on linear regressions with perceptive variables. A cross validation of the quality models extracted from Paris data was carried out by conducting the same survey in Milan. The proposed sound quality general model is correlated with the real perceived sound quality (72%). Another model without visual amenity and familiarity is 58% correlated with perceived sound quality. In order to improve the sound quality indicator, a site classification was performed by Kohonen’s Artificial Neural Network algorithm, and seven specific class models were developed. These specific models attribute more importance on source events and are slightly closer to the individual data than the global model. In general, the Parisian models underestimate the sound quality of Milan environments assessed by Italian people.;,citation_author=Paola Ricciardi;,citation_author=Pauline Delaitre;,citation_author=Catherine Lavandier;,citation_author=Francesca Torchia;,citation_author=Pierre Aumond;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.4929747;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_pmid=26520314;,citation_volume=138;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">

The effects of anxiety symptoms on the anticipatory auditory looming effect synergistically depend on the dimension of perceived personal danger assessed by the LCS (physical or social threat). Depression symptoms, in contrast to anxiety symptoms, predict a diminution of the auditory looming bias. Findings broaden our understanding of the links between cognitive-affective states and auditory perception processes and lend further support to past studies providing evidence that the looming cognitive style is related to bias in threat processing.;,citation_author=John H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The application of the soundscape approach in the evaluation of the urban public spaces;,citation_abstract=An important issue in the development of European cities is the design and renovation of the urban public areas. Typically, a broad variety of approaches (sociological, ecological, environmental, physical, etc.) is needed and earlier studies have shown the necessity of the transversal multi-disciplinary approach in this issue. In order to study the acoustical dimension, the concept of soundscape needs to be proposed and elaborated. The soundscape approach differs from the classical statistical noise analysis in the evaluation of a context-related noise and in the extrapolation of environmental sounds in its complexity. Nowadays, even by using recently developed sophisticated acoustical and psycho-acoustical measurable and quantifiable parameters, it still remains difficult to grasp the complete meaning of a soundscape in words only or by numbers only. Our hypothesis is that the description of the city soundscape might be successfully done by combination of acoustical numbers and words.;,citation_author=Monika Rychtarikova;,citation_author=Gerrit Vermeir;,citation_author=Markieta Domecka;,citation_publication_date=2008;,citation_cover_date=2008;,citation_year=2008;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.conforg.fr/acoustics2008/cdrom/data/articles/001649.pdf;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.2935528;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundscape categorization on the basis of objective acoustical parameters;,citation_abstract=A soundscape assessment method that is suitable for the automatic categorization of binaurally recorded sound in urban public places is presented. Soundscape categories are established as a result of an automatic clustering algorithm based on multi-parameter analysis by 13 acoustical parameters used as similarity measures, on a large set of sound recordings. One of the main advantages of the followed approach allows to take into account an optimized set of parameters that are judged relevant and necessary for an appropriate description of the sampled acoustical scenarios. The Euclidian distance based clustering of the 370 recordings of typical situations based on these parameters, allows to categorize each binaurally recorded sound sample into one of 20 proposed clusters (soundscape categories). The common features among members within each cluster allow to identify &amp;amp;amp;quot;how the acoustical scenario of the members sounds like&amp;quot;. The hybrid use of an optimized set of standard acoustical quantities, such as sound pressure level, together with well known psychoacoustical parameters that directly relate to human perception of sound, makes the propose method very robust.;,citation_author=Monika Rychtáriková;,citation_author=Gerrit Vermeir;,citation_publication_date=2013-02;,citation_cover_date=2013-02;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2011.01.004;,citation_issn=0003-682X;,citation_volume=74;,citation_journal_title=Applied Acoustics;,citation_publisher=Elsevier;">

The results of the comparison among the above three measurements suggest that noise levels were lower during September-October 2020 than during the declaration of the state of emergency in May 2020. In the period from May to October 2020, the noise level was significantly higher in July and August of the same year due to the sound of cicadas, which are common in this area. This suggests that it is difficult to set the target values of the acoustic environment planning by referring to the low noise level at lockdown or similar measures in areas with large seasonal variations in acoustic environment. Although many case studies are necessary to obtain appropriate target values, one case study is presented in this communication to illustrate an example and discuss its difficulty.;,citation_author=Kimihiro Sakagami;,citation_publication_date=2020-12;,citation_cover_date=2020-12;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.mdpi.com/2413-8851/4/4/63;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.3390/urbansci4040063;,citation_volume=4;,citation_journal_title=Urban Science;,citation_publisher=Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Timbre Cues and the Identification of Musical Instruments;,citation_abstract=This study was designed to evaluate the relative importance of transients, harmonic structure, and vibrato as timbre cues in the absolute judgment of musical tones. Tape recordings were made of tones played on ten different instruments at C4, F4, and A4 of the equally tempered scale. Appropriate splicing and retaping procedures provided a test tape with 300 randomly ordered tonal stimuli (10 instruments X 3 frequencies X 2 playing styles X 5 types of tones). Twenty trained musicians were tested and retested on the final tape in two experimental sessions. S’s were provided with a reminder list of 39 instruments (grouped into classes) and were required to identify the particular instrument for each tonal stimulus. The results of this study indicate that (1) some instruments (e.g., clarinet, oboe, and flute) are identified more easily than others (e.g., violin, ’cello, and bassoon); (2) more correct identifications are made at F4 than C4 or A4; (3) the best identification is made for stimuli consisting of initial transients and a short steady state; (4) a vibrato tone is better identified than a non-vibrato tone; and (5) identification is improved significantly with practice.

Substantial progress has been made toward resolving each of these issues. Ten motivationally distinct value types that were likely to be recognized within and across cultures and used to form value priorities were identified. Set of value types that was relatively comprehensive, encompassing virtually all the types of values to which individuals attribute at least moderate importance as criteria of evaluation was demonstrated. The evidence from 20 countries was assembled, showing that the meaning of the value types and most of the single values that constitute them was reasonably equivalent across most groups. Two basic dimensions that organize value systems into an integrated motivational structure with consistent value conflicts and compatibilities were discovered. By identifying universal aspects of value content and structure, the chapter has laid the foundations for investigating culture-specific aspects in the future.;,citation_author=Shalom H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assessing hearing by measuring heartbeat: The effect of sound level;,citation_abstract=Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive brain imaging technique that measures changes in oxygenated and de-oxygenated hemoglobin concentration and can provide a measure of brain activity. In addition to neural activity, fNIRS signals contain components that can be used to extract physiological information such as cardiac mea- sures. Previous studies have shown changes in cardiac activity in response to different sounds. This study investigated whether cardiac responses collected using fNIRS differ for different loudness of sounds. fNIRS data were collected from 28 normal hearing partici- pants. Cardiac response measures evoked by broadband, amplitude-modulated sounds were extracted for four sound intensities ranging from near-threshold to comfortably loud levels (15, 40, 65 and 90 dB Sound Pressure Level (SPL)). Following onset of the noise stimulus, heart rate initially decreased for sounds of 15 and 40 dB SPL, reaching a signifi- cantly lower rate at 15 dB SPL. For sounds at 65 and 90 dB SPL, increases in heart rate were seen. To quantify the timing of significant changes, inter-beat intervals were assessed. For sounds at 40 dB SPL, an immediate significant change in the first two inter-beat intervals following sound onset was found. At other levels, the most significant change appeared later (beats 3 to 5 following sound onset). In conclusion, changes in heart rate were associated with the level of sound with a clear difference in response to near-threshold sounds com- pared to comfortably loud sounds. These findings may be used alone or in conjunction with other measures such as fNIRS brain activity for evaluation of hearing ability.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Task-dependent neural representations of salient events in dynamic auditory scenes;,citation_abstract=Selecting pertinent events in the cacophony of sounds that impinge on our ears every day is regulated by the acoustic salience of sounds in the scene as well as their behavioral relevance as dictated by top-down task-dependent demands. The current study aims to explore the neural signature of both facets of attention, as well as their possible interactions in the context of auditory scenes. Using a paradigm with dynamic auditory streams with occasional salient events, we recorded neurophysiological responses of human listeners using EEG while manipulating the subjects’ attentional state as well as the presence or absence of a competing auditory stream. Our results showed that salient events caused an increase in the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) irrespective of attentional state or complexity of the scene. Such increase supplemented ASSR increases due to task-driven attention. Salient events also evoked a strong N1 peak in the ERP response when listeners were attending to the target sound stream, accompanied by an MMN-like component in some cases and changes in the P1 and P300 components under all listening conditions. Overall, bottom-up attention induced by a salient change in the auditory stream appears to mostly modulate the amplitude of the steady-state response and certain event-related potentials to salient sound events; though this modulation is affected by top-down attentional processes and the prominence of these events in the auditory scene as well.;,citation_author=Lan Shuai;,citation_author=Mounya Elhilali;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=8 JUL;,citation_doi=10.3389/fnins.2014.00203;,citation_issn=1662-453X;,citation_pmid=25100934;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Neuroscience;">

The diurnal histogram distributions of the quiet-times reveals a power-law with the same exponent value, but the statistic distribution, in this case, shows an overlap of an additional urban acoustic phenomenon corresponding to time duration above 1s. On the other side, the sound-times, both diurnal and nocturnal, follow a log-normal distribution with mean value around 0.1s, which characterizes a typical temporal characteristic-scale for the duration of sounds in the urban soundscape.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Capturing spatial attention with multisensory cues: A review;,citation_abstract=The last 30 years have seen numerous studies demonstrating unimodal and crossmodal spatial cuing effects. However, surprisingly few studies have attempted to investigate whether multisensory cues might be any more effective in capturing a person’s spatial attention than unimodal cues. Indeed, until very recently, the consensus view was that multisensory cues were, in fact, no more effective. However, the results of several recent studies have overturned this conclusion, by showing that multisensory cues retain their attention-capturing ability under conditions of perceptual load (i.e., when participants are simultaneously engaged in a concurrent attention-demanding task) while their constituent signals (when presented unimodally) do not. Here we review the empirical literature on multisensory spatial cuing effects and highlight the implications that this research has for the design of more effective warning signals in applied settings.  2009 Elsevier B.V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Noise, noise sensitivity and psychiatric disorder: epidemiological and psychophysiological studies;,citation_abstract=Noise, a prototypical environmental stressor, has clear health effects in causing hearing loss but other health effects are less evident. Noise exposure may lead to minor emotional symptoms but the evidence of elevated levels of aircraft noise leading to psychiatric hospital admissions and psychiatric disorder in the community is contradictory. Despite this there are well documented associatons between noise exposure and chages in performance, sleep disturbance and emotioal reactions such as annoyance. Moreover, annoyance is associated with both environmental noise level and psychological and physical symptoms, psychiatric disorder and use of health services. It seems likely that existing psychiatric disorder contributes to high levels of annoyance. However, there is also the possibility that tendency to annoyance may be a risk factor for psychiatric morbidity. Although noise level explains a significant proportion of the variance in annoyance, the other major factor, confirmed in many studies, is subjective sensitivity to noise. Noise sensitivity is also related to psychiatric disorder. The evidence for noise sensitivity being a risk facor for psychiatric disorder would be greater if it were a stable personality characteristic, and preceded psychiatric morbidity. The stability of noise sensitivity and whether it is merely secondary to psychiatric disorder or is a risk factor for psychiatric disorder as well as annoyance is examined in two studies in this monograph: a six year follow-up of a group of highly noise sensitive and low noise sensitive women; and a longitudinal study of depressed patients and matched control subjects examining changes in noise sensitivity with recovery from depression. A further dimension of noise effects concerns the impact of noise on the autonomic nervous system. Most physiological responses to noise habituate rapidly but in som people physiological responses persist. It is not clear whether this sub-sample is also subjectivley sensitive to noise and whether failure to habituate to environmental noise may also represent a biological indicator of vulnerability to psychiatric disorder. in these studies noise sensitivity was found to be moderately stable and associated with current psychiatric disorder and a disposition to negative affectivity. Noise sensitivity levels did fall with recover from depression but still remained high, suggesting an underlying high level of noise sensitivity. Noise sensitivity was related to higher tonic skin conductance and heart rate and greater defence/startle responses during noise exposure in the laboratory. Noise sensitive people attend more to noises, discriminate more between noises, find noises more threatening and out of their control, and react to, and adapt to noises more slowly than less noise sensitive people. Noise sensitivity through its association with greater perception of environmental threat, its link with negative affectivity and physiological arousal to noise may be an indicator of vulnerability to minor psychiatric disorder.;,citation_author=Stephen A.

Using mixed-methods, soundscape measurements were collected with questionnaires, recordings, interviews, logs, and observations. This analysis concentrates on quantitative findings from the questionnaires, which probed soundscape quality (SSQP), mood, and noise sensitivity (NSS). Questionnaires were administered over 3 conditions: pre-installation with park users, post-installation with Musikiosk users, and post-installation with park users not using Musikiosk. Musikiosk significantly improved the extent to which the park soundscape was judged as pleasant (and conversely, less unpleasant). For all conditions, mood increased during the park visit. This mood benefit was significantly greater after the installation of Musikiosk, and even greater for Musikiosk users. Overall, ratings of soundscape calmness were not significantly different across conditions; however, Musikiosk users rated the soundscape as more vibrant. Findings indicate that Musikiosk, while generally adding decibels, contributes to a more pleasant soundscape and mood improvements without detrimental effects on the perceived calmness, even for park users not using Musikiosk.;,citation_author=Daniel Steele;,citation_author=Edda Bild;,citation_author=Catherine Guastavino;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ince/incecp/2016/00000253/00000004/art00085;,citation_issue=4;,citation_issn=0736-2935;,citation_volume=253;,citation_journal_title=INTER-NOISE and NOISE-CON Congress and Conference Proceedings;">

We discuss Musikiosk, an unsupervised installation allowing users to play audio content from their own devices over publicly provided speakers. Deployed in the gazebo of a pocket park in Montreal (Parc du Portugal), in the summer of 2015, its effects over the quality of the public urban experience of park users were researched using a mixed methods approach, combining questionnaires, interviews, behavioral observations, and acoustic monitoring, as well as public outreach activities. An integrated analysis of results revealed positive outcomes both at the individual level (in terms of soundscape evaluations and mood benefits) and at the social level (in terms of increased interaction and lingering behaviors). The park was perceived as more pleasant and convivial for both users and non-users, and the perceived soundscape calmness and appropriateness were not affected. Musikiosk animated an underused section of the park without displacing existing users while promoting increased interaction and sharing, particularly of music. It also led to a strategy for interacting with both residents and city decision-makers on matters related to urban sound.;,citation_author=Daniel Steele;,citation_author=Edda Bild;,citation_author=Cynthia Tarlao;,citation_author=Catherine Guastavino;,citation_publication_date=2019-05;,citation_cover_date=2019-05;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.3390/ijerph16101865;,citation_issn=1660-4601;,citation_volume=16;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;,citation_publisher=MDPI AG;">

Ercan Altinsoy Abstract Road traffic noise is the most annoying form of environmental noise pollution. The enforcement of using artificially generated noise for electrically powered vehicles is currently on the rise. Regarding to that, it is important to generate sounds regarding to the regulations which are not annoying. While many annoyance models are available around the world, these models cannot be simply generalized for these new sounds and while it is very time consuming to measure the annoyance for each newly generated noise with an listening test, the idea came up to use artificial neural networks instead. The aim of this work is to determine the annoyance of different electric vehicle sounds for a constant speed, single car pass-by situation. For this purpose, the differences in annoyance are investigated with perception studies. The correlation between physical-psychoacoustical parameters and annoyance estimations obtained from jury testing is also investigated in this study. Moreover, an artificial neural network (ANN) is also used as a prediction tool of annoyance estimations for further evaluations of different possible stimuli. Overall, a total of 150 ANN models with different hidden layers were undertaken in this research. The best-performing models were compared with linear regression models based on psychoacoustic parameter.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The effect of sound level on perception of reproduced soundscapes;,citation_abstract=The aim of this work was to investigate the perception of soundscape reproduced by an ambisonic reproduction system on a horizontal plane, how the experience of space affected the perception of soundscape reproduction, and how the sound level adjustment on soundscape reproduction affected the perception of soundscape compared with actual conditions. There were three experiments conducted: a soundwalk in situ in Manchester (United Kingdom) city centre, listening tests in Salford (United Kingdom), and listening tests in Bandung (Indonesia). The listening tests used material recorded from four locations on the soundwalk route in Manchester. The Salford listening tests were performed at the in-situ measured sound level, and the participants were asked to adjust the sound level to the level that represents actual locations. The listening test in Bandung was conducted to understand the effect of participants who never come to the actual location to the perception of soundscape and the sound level adjustment. The listening tests in Bandung were conducted at the in situ sound level, at 9.5 dB below the in situ sound level (based on the preference sound level from the experiment in Salford), and the participants were also requested to adjust the sound level to the level that represents the actual space (to examine the consistency with the experiment in Salford). In each case, soundscape perception was measured on 19 semantic differential scales. Analysis of the semantic differential results showed that the ambisonic reproduction produced a similar subjective experience to the in situ soundwalk when the reproduction sound level was 9.5 dB lower than the actual sound level in situ. Reproduction at the actual sound level in situ produced a different dimensional space. The study shows that the sound level adjustment of soundscape reproduction in laboratory experiment produces more ecologically valid results compared to the reproduction at the actual sound level in situ.;,citation_author=Anugrah Sabdono Sudarsono;,citation_author=Yiu W.

The focus when establishing the significance was set on their relevance with respect to the annoyance of the study participants. In order to carry out this experiment, an acoustic environment recording was made in which short distracting signals were inserted into the acoustic environment background sound. The recording obtained in the described way was then reproduced to listeners in laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the experiment was envisaged in a way that the participants had the option to adjust the following acoustic parameters: the amplitude, duration and the amplitude growth rates of the short signals. In order to prove the statistical significance of the obtained results from the experiment and the study premise, the chi-square test was applied. Thus, according to the results of the study, the ranking of the objective acoustic parameters was achieved with respect to the human annoyance i.e., it can be concluded that the most common reason for the human annoyance in different acoustic environments is the sound amplitude, then its duration and finally its amplitude growth rate.;,citation_author=Mia Suhanek;,citation_author=Sanja Grubeša;,citation_author=Ivan urek;,citation_author=Antonio Petošić;,citation_publication_date=2020-05;,citation_cover_date=2020-05;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=11;,citation_doi=10.3390/app10113787;,citation_issn=2076-3417;,citation_volume=10;,citation_journal_title=Applied Sciences;,citation_publisher=MDPI AG;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Classification of soundscapes of urban public open spaces;,citation_abstract=It is increasingly acknowledged by landscape architects and urban planners that the soundscape contributes significantly to the perception of urban public open spaces. Describing and classifying this impact, however, remains a challenge. This article presents a hierarchical method for classification that distinguishes between backgrounded and foregrounded, disruptive and supportive, and finally calming and stimulating soundscapes. This four-class classification is applied to a growing collection of immersive audio-visual recordings of sound environments from around the world that could be explored using virtual reality playback. To validate the proposed methodology, an experiment involving 40 participants and 50 soundscape stimuli collected in urban public open spaces worldwide was conducted. The experiment showed that (1)the virtual reality headset reproduction based on affordable spatial audio with 360-degree video recordings was perceived as ecologically valid in terms of realism and immersion; (2)the proposed classification method results in well-separated classes; (3)membership to these classes could be explained by physical parameters, both regarding sound and vision. Moreover, models based on a limited number of acoustical indicators were constructed that could correctly classify a soundscape in each of the four proposed categories, with an accuracy exceeding 88% on an independent dataset.;,citation_author=Kang Sun;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Karlo Filipan;,citation_author=Francesco Aletta;,citation_author=Timothy Van Renterghem;,citation_author=Toon De Pessemier;,citation_author=Wout Joseph;,citation_author=Dick Botteldooren;,citation_publication_date=2019-04;,citation_cover_date=2019-04;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204618305899?casa_token=sYi3Kud3lCEAAAAA:NJf4ez3PAYr6iclRTUqf1BmIZUaM0N2JolnGYeZY2hldhj0hZ7dvj_yVzgdsOyTMVwQPLqS-2eo;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.04.016;,citation_issn=0169-2046;,citation_journal_title=Landscape and Urban Planning;">

The sharpness percept also influences the overall &amp;amp;quot;pleasantness&quot; of a sound and is thus important to sound acceptability.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparing soundscape evaluations in French and English across three studies in Montreal;,citation_abstract=Soundscape evaluations rely heavily on verbal descriptors often using Likert-type scales such as the Swedish Soundscape Quality Protocol (SSQP). While these scales have been validated in Swedish and English, the French-speaking soundscape community has struggled to find suitable French equivalents. Questionnaires (N = 485) were gathered in French and English in 3 urban locations (small and large park, a restaurant) using the SSQP, noise sensitivity (NSS) and restorativeness scales in addition to open-ended questions. A principal components analysis revealed that the French translation of the SSQP yielded similar components to the English translation, with one main difference concerning the &amp;amp;amp;quot;monotonous&amp;quot; scale. In line with previous studies using the SSQP, the first components refer to &quot;pleasant&quot; and &quot;eventful&quot; respectively for both French and English. The third component however was different across languages (&quot;monotonous&quot; only in English, &quot;monotonous&quot; and &quot;calm&quot; in French). Regarding NSS, both languages produced one component; however, minor, albeit significant differences, were explained by the age of the respondents. This across-study analysis, aided by Montreal’s unique status as a bilingual city, supports future uses of French-language materials for soundscape evaluations, especially the SSQP and NSS.;,citation_author=Cynthia Tarlao;,citation_author=Daniel Steele;,citation_author=Pauline Fernandez;,citation_author=Catherine Guastavino;,citation_publication_date=2016;,citation_cover_date=2016;,citation_year=2016;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the INTER-NOISE 2016 - 45th international congress and exposition on noise control engineering: Towards a quieter future;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Activity interference caused by traffic noise: Experimental determination and modeling of the number of noticed sound events;,citation_abstract=Activity interference is widely considered to be a central mechanism linking exposure to noise and emergence of annoyance. Salient sound events in particular may divert attention from the task at hand, thereby reducing task performance. Sound events caused by traffic noise intruding the dwelling are therefore often found to be a main cause of community noise annoyance. In this work, experimental and simulation results on activity interference caused by traffic noise are compared. On the one hand, an experiment on activity interference by traffic noise was conducted in a realistic setting resembling an at-home situation. Subjects were instructed to read, while being exposed to a combination of road and railway traffic noise. The number of train pass-by events, the distance to the railway track and the emergence of train events above the background noise was varied among subjects. After completion of the reading task, the subjects had to evaluate their perceived disturbance due to passing trains and to report how many trains they noticed in retrospective. On the other hand, a computational model of auditory attention was used to determine the number of train pass-by events that subjects would notice, solely based on the acoustic stimuli used in the perception experiment. Using an optimized stochastic function that simulates the attention spend on the reading activity of the subjects, the model was able to replicate trends found in the empirical results, and estimated the number of noticed train events quite well.

This study attempts to characterize the emotional responses to different kinds of listening. Methods: Three experiments were conducted: (1) School children were exposed to live chamber music, (2) two adult audiences who were accustomed to classical music as a genre listened to chamber music, and (3) elderly listeners were exposed to recorded classical music of a sad character with and without words. Participants were asked to fill in visual analogue 10-cm scales along dimensions of: tiredness-arousal, sadness-joy, and anxiety-calmness. Ratings before exposure were compared with ratings after exposure. Results: The strongest positive emotional responses were observed in the live performances for listeners accustomed to classical music. School children tended to become tired during the concert, particularly the youngest children. There was a calming effect among school children, but in the oldest category increased joy was reported. Conclusions: The findings indicate that emotional response to music varies by type of audience (young, old, experience of classical music), and live or recorded music.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;;,citation_author=Töres Theorell;,citation_author=Eva Bojner Horwitz;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://www.mdpi.com/2305-6320/6/1/16;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.3390/medicines6010016;,citation_issn=2305-6320;,citation_volume=6;,citation_journal_title=Medicines;">

Since its first publication in 1998, the WHO-5 has been translated into more than 30 languages and has been used in research studies all over the world. We now provide a systematic review of the literature on the WHO-5. Methods: We conducted a systematic search for literature on the WHO-5 in PubMed and PsycINFO in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. In our review of the identified articles, we focused particularly on the following aspects: (1) the clinimetric validity of the WHO-5; (2) the responsiveness/sensitivity of the WHO-5 in controlled clinical trials; (3) the potential of the WHO-5 as a screening tool for depression, and (4) the applicability of the WHO-5 across study fields. Results: A total of 213 articles met the predefined criteria for inclusion in the review. The review demonstrated that the WHO-5 has high clinimetric validity, can be used as an outcome measure balancing the wanted and unwanted effects of treatments, is a sensitive and specific screening tool for depression and its applicability across study fields is very high. Conclusions: The WHO-5 is a short questionnaire consisting of 5 simple and non-invasive questions, which tap into the subjective well-being of the respondents. The scale has adequate validity both as a screening tool for depression and as an outcome measure in clinical trials and has been applied successfully across a wide range of study fields.;,citation_author=Christian Winther Topp;,citation_author=Søren Dinesen Østergaard;,citation_author=Susan Søndergaard;,citation_author=Per Bech;,citation_publication_date=2015;,citation_cover_date=2015;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1159/000376585;,citation_issn=1423-0348;,citation_pmid=25831962;,citation_volume=84;,citation_journal_title=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward an Improved Model of Auditory Saliency;,citation_abstract=While visual saliency models are approaching maturity, their auditory counterparts remain in their infancy. This is mainly due to the difficulties of gathering basic data, and oversimplifications such as an assumption of monaural signals. Moreover, conven- tional testing approaches for evaluating auditory saliency models tend to be overly simplistic. To address these shortcomings, we developed an experimental procedure for testing auditory saliency along with more formal- ized stimulus-selection criteria to support more versatile and eco- logically relevant saliency models. This work is described, along with an analysis of some relevant acoustical correlates that emerge from the experiments. The results motivate the formulation of a measure of sound complexity and appear to favor time-domain, rather than frequency-domain analysis to describe saliency. Fi- nally, some conclusions are drawn regarding the definition of an expanded feature set to be used for auditory saliency modeling and prediction in the context of natural, everyday sounds. 1.;,citation_author=Francesco Tordini;,citation_author=As Albert S.

Chemical defences, which may have antimicrobial or cytotoxic capabilities in addition to anti-predatory purposes, have been recorded from zoanthid, echinoderm and tunicate larvae. Many other aspects of immunity remain to be investigated in invertebrate larvae, and additional methods need to be developed for easier recognition and quantification of the larval immune response. The marine mussel, Mytilus edulis, is a species of particular importance, from both economic and ecological viewpoints. A disaggregation technique has been tested by the authors on M. edulis larvae and used to show that the larval cells possess certain enzymes associated with adult mussel haemocytes and are capable of phagocytosis.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Statistics of natural reverberation enable perceptual separation of sound and space;,citation_abstract=In everyday listening, sound reaches our ears directly from a source as well as indirectly via reflections known as reverberation. Reverberation profoundly distorts the sound from a source, yet humans can both identify sound sources and distinguish environments from the resulting sound, via mechanisms that remain unclear. The core computational challenge is that the acoustic signatures of the source and environment are combined in a single signal received by the ear. Here we ask whether our recognition of sound sources and spaces reflects an ability to separate their effects and whether any such separation is enabled by statistical regularities of real-world reverberation. To first determine whether such statistical regularities exist, we measured impulse responses (IRs) of 271 spaces sampled from the distribution encountered by humans during daily life. The sampled spaces were diverse, but their IRs were tightly constrained, exhibiting exponential decay at frequency-dependent rates: Mid frequencies reverberated longest whereas higher and lower frequencies decayed more rapidly, presumably due to absorptive properties of materials and air. To test whether humans leverage these regularities, we manipulated IR decay characteristics in simulated reverberant audio. Listeners could discriminate sound sources and environments from these signals, but their abilities degraded when reverberation characteristics deviated from those of real-world environments. Subjectively, atypical IRs were mistaken for sound sources. The results suggest the brain separates sound into contributions from the source and the environment, constrained by a prior on natural reverberation. This separation process may contribute to robust recognition while providing information about spaces around us.;,citation_author=James Traer;,citation_author=Josh H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stress recovery during exposure to natural and urban environments;,citation_abstract=Different conceptual perspectives converge to predict that if individuals are stressed, an encounter with most unthreatening natural environments will have a stress reducing or restorative influence, whereas many urban environments will hamper recuperation. Hypotheses regarding emotional, attentional and physiological aspects of stress reducing influences of nature are derived from a psycho-evolutionary theory. To investigate these hypotheses, 120 subjects first viewed a stressful movie, and then were exposed to color/sound videotapes of one of six different natural and urban settings. Data concerning stress recovery during the environmental presentations were obtained from self-ratings of affective states and a battery of physiological measures: heart period, muscle tension, skin conductance and pulse transit time, a non-invasive measure that correlates with systolic blood pressure. Findings from the physiological and verbal measures converged to indicate that recovery was faster and more complete when subjects were exposed to natural rather than urban environments. The pattern of physiological findings raised the possibility that responses to nature had a salient parasympathetic nervous system component; however, there was no evidence of pronounced parasympathetic involvement in responses to the urban settings. There were directional differences in cardiac responses to the natural vs urban settings, suggesting that attention/intake was higher during the natural exposures. However, both the stressor film and the nature settings elicited high levels of involuntary or automatic attention, which contradicts the notion that restorative influences of nature stem from involuntary attention or fascination. Findings were consistent with the predictions of the psycho-evolutionary theory that restorative influences of nature involve a shift towards a more positively-toned emotional state, positive changes in physiological activity levels, and that these changes are accompanied by sustained attention/intake. Content differences in terms of natural vs human-made properties appeared decisive in accounting for the differences in recuperation and perceptual intake.;,citation_author=Roger S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does lighting contribute to the reassurance of pedestrians at night-time in residential roads?;,citation_abstract=One of the reasons why road lighting may be installed in residential areas is to increase pedestrian reassurance, their confidence when walking alone at night, which in past studies has been addressed under the label of perceived safety or fear of crime. This article reviews existing literature examining the possible effects of street lighting on pedestrian reassurance in residential streets. Such data would allow better understanding of whether lighting is effective, and of whether variations in lighting conditions such as illuminance and lamp type, are effective at improving reassurance. While several studies have suggested that lighting affects reassurance it is possible that fear of crime is exaggerated by the procedure with which it is measured. Placing lighting in the overall context of reassurance at night time, by the consideration of other attributes such as spatial features, familiarity and the presence of other people, gives a holistic picture of the pedestrian experience. A pilot study was carried out using an alternative method for determination of whether lighting can aid reassurance in residential roads, with the aims of understanding firstly what is important for pedestrian reassurance, and then assessing whether this affected by light. This should form a realistic basis from which to recommend design criteria for residential roads.;,citation_author=J. Unwin;,citation_author=S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Improving the accuracy of engineering models at shielded building facades: experimental analysis of turbulence scattering;,citation_abstract=Noise mapping models are able to accurately predict directly exposed facade levels near busy roads on condition that sufficiently detailed traffic data is available. At the non-directly exposed side of the building, however, common practice application of standard methods strongly underpredicts sound pressure levels, potentially leading to an incorrect assessment of noise annoyance and sleep disturbance. The concept of background noise mapping was proposed before, which has the important advantage that it can increase the accuracy of existing noise maps at a limited computational cost. In this study, long-term meteorological and noise data showed that turbulence scattering contributes significantly to the noise level at shielded facades, already at sound frequencies below 1 kHz. Periods with strong atmospheric turbulence are dominant for long-term equivalent noise levels as typically used in strategic noise maps. A comparison between predictions and measurements show that rather high turbulence strengths should be used when producing noise maps.;,citation_author=Timothy Van Renterghem;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Review of acoustic comfort evaluation in dwellings: Part III – airborne sound data associated with subjective responses in laboratory tests;,citation_abstract=The concept of acoustic comfort is hardly defined and used to refer to conditions of low noise levels or annoyance based on standardized descriptors. Airborne and impact sound measurements are used to rate acoustic comfort in dwellings, but they often do not express human perception of noise or comfort. If the descriptors are statistically associated with self-reported responses, they can be used as prediction models and considered sufficient for acoustic comfort assessment. This review article presents studies that approach acoustic comfort in dwellings via the association of acoustic data and subjective responses in laboratory tests. Specifically, we investigate the cases of impact sound, since it is usually reported as the most disturbing noise source in dwellings. We also evaluated the reviewed studies with the Bradford Hill’s criteria. The reviewed studies indicate that self-reported annoyance to impact sound is an important issue and it can be predicted well in overall. Various standardized descriptors are studied and associate sufficiently with subjective responses. Inclusion of low frequencies down to 50 Hz in measurements improves the association of impact sound descriptors to subjective responses. Some impact noise stimuli associate only with some descriptors but not all. From the standardized impact sources, the tapping machine is the most efficient to predict overall annoyance and the impact ball for human walking or typical impact sounds in dwellings.;,citation_author=Nikolaos-Georgios Vardaxis;,citation_author=Delphine Bard;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/1351010x18788685;,citation_issn=2059-8025;,citation_volume=25;,citation_journal_title=Building Acoustics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Review of acoustic comfort evaluation in dwellings – part I: Associations of acoustic field data to subjective responses from building surveys;,citation_abstract=Acoustic comfort is a concept hardly described in the literature. But it has been used in engineering typically to refer to low noise or annoyance in order to invoke no discomfort. Current standardized methods for airborne and impact sound reduction are deployed to assess acoustic comfort in dwellings. However, the measured sound pressure levels do not represent comfort. The latter should include further the human perception of the acoustic environment. Therefore, this article reviews studies that approached acoustic comfort through the association of objective and subjective field data, combining in situ acoustic measurements and survey responses from residents. We evaluated the studies using Bradford Hill’s criteria. Most researches focus on self-reported noise annoyance while some others on satisfaction responses. Many studies were found incomprehensibly described: often vital data of statistical evaluation or study design are lacking. The results indicate that noise is a significant issue in living environments, especially certain impact noise types. The use of extended low-frequency spectra down to 50 Hz was suggested for impact measurements in order to predict better self-reported noise response. Greater problems with low-frequency transmission are displayed in lightweight structures which perform inefficiently compared to heavyweight components. Harmonization of presented results and study design details should be taken into account for future articles.;,citation_author=Nikolaos-Georgios Vardaxis;,citation_author=Delphine Bard;,citation_author=Kerstin Persson Waye;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/1351010X18762687;,citation_issn=2059-8025;,citation_volume=25;,citation_journal_title=Building Acoustics;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Modeling Evaluations of Low-Level Sounds in Everyday Situations Using Linear Machine Learning for Variable Selection;,citation_abstract=Human sound evaluations not only depend on the characteristics of the sound but are also driven by factors related to the listener and the situation. Our research aimed to investigate crucial factors influencing the perception of low-level sounds as they-in addition to the often-researched loud-level sounds-might be decisive to people’s quality of life and health. We conducted an online study in which 1,301 participants reported on up to three everyday situations in which they perceived low-level sounds, resulting in a total of 2,800 listening situations. Participants rated the sounds’ perceived loudness, timbre, and tonality. Additionally, they described the listening situations employing situational eight dimensions and reported their affective states. All sounds were then assigned to the categories natural, human, and technical. Linear models suggest a significant difference of annoyance ratings across sound categories for binary loudness levels. The ability to mentally fade-out sound was the most crucial situational variable after valence, arousal, and the situation dimensions positivity and negativity. We ultimately selected the most important factors from a large number of independent variables by applying the percentile least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regularization method. The resulting linear regression showed that this novel machine-learning variable-selection technique is applicable in hypothesis testing of noise effects and soundscape research. The typical problems of overfitting and multicollinearity that occur when many situational and personal variables are involved were overcome. This study provides an extensive database of evaluated everyday sounds and listening situations, offering an enormous test power. Our machine learning approach, whose application leads to comprehensive models for the prediction of sound perception, is available for future study designs aiming to model sound perception and evaluation.;,citation_author=Siegbert Versümer;,citation_author=Jochen Steffens;,citation_author=Patrick Blättermann;,citation_author=Jörg Becker-Schweitzer;,citation_publication_date=2020-10;,citation_cover_date=2020-10;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2020.570761;,citation_issn=1664-1078;,citation_volume=11;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychology;,citation_publisher=Frontiers;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=”1/f noise” in music: Music from 1/f noise;,citation_abstract=The spectral density of fluctuations in the audio power of many musical selections and of English speech varies approximately as 1/f (f is the frequency) down to a frequency of 5x10^-4 Hz. This result implies that the audio-power fluctuations are correlated over all times in the same manners as &amp;amp;amp;quot;1/f noise&amp;quot; in electronic components. The frequency fluctuations of music also have a 1/f spectral density at frequencies down to the inverse of the length of the piece of music. The frequency fluctuations of English speech have a quite different behavio, with a single characteristic time of about 0.1s, the average length of a syllable. The observations on music suggest that 1/f noise is a good choice for stochastic composition. Compositions in which the frequency and duration of each note were determined by 1/f noise sources sounded pleasing. Those generated by white-noise sources sound too random, while those generated by 1/f^2 noise sounded too correlated.;,citation_author=Richard F.

Our systematic review of research articles published in top physiology journals (n = 703) suggests that, as scientists, we urgently need to change our practices for presenting continuous data in small sample size studies. Papers rarely included scatterplots, box plots, and histograms that allow readers to critically evaluate continuous data. Most papers presented continuous data in bar and line graphs. This is problematic, as many different data distributions can lead to the same bar or line graph. The full data may suggest different conclusions from the summary statistics.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Tidy Data;,citation_abstract=A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of untidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.;,citation_author=Hadley Wickham;,citation_publication_date=2014;,citation_cover_date=2014;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.18637/jss.v059.i10;,citation_volume=59;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Statistical Software;,citation_publisher=Foundation for Open Access Statistic;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A psychological taxonomy of trait-descriptive terms: The interpersonal domain;,citation_abstract=The eventual aim of the research reported here is the development of a comprehensive taxonomy of trait-descriptive terms in the English language. Building on earlier work of G. W. Allport, W. T. Norman, and L. R. Goldberg, preliminary a priori distinctions were made among different domains of trait categories. General procedures for developing structured taxonomies within domains are illustrated with reference to the interpersonal domain. Theoretical considerations dictated the definition of the universe of content, the choice of measurement model, and the procedures for classifying terms within the domain. Eight adjectival scales were developed as markers of the principal vectors of the interpersonal domain. The substantive, structural, and psychometric characteristics of these scales were found to be highly satisfactory. Hence, they may prove useful both as assessment devices in their own right and as reference points for the classification of variables in personality and social psychology.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Soundscape evaluation : Binaural or monaural ?;,citation_abstract=The aim of this study is to explore the performance of binaural and monaural recordings in soundscape evaluation. Twelve sites with different acoustic scenarios were chosen, where binaural and monaural recordings were simultaneously made. Nine soundscape indicators were assessed by residents through a laboratory-based auditory test. The results showed that the two recording methods present good agreement on most soundscape evaluation indicators including overall impression, acoustic comfort, pleasantness, annoyance, eventfulness, and loudness. The two recording methods were found to be correlated with different indicators in a similar way. For most sites, the two recording methods were significantly correlated excluding for directionality. For both recording methods, the A-weighted sound pressul level was found to have a weak impact on soundscape evaluation. Reverberation time significantly affects reverberance through binaural recordings. Overall, for most soundscape indicators, it is feasible to use both recording methods, although when &amp;amp;amp;quot;realism&amp;quot;, &quot;reverberance&quot;, and &quot;directivity&quot; are involved in evaluation, binaural recordings will render corresponding perception more consistently than the monaural.;,citation_author=Chunyang Xu;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.5102164;,citation_volume=145;,citation_journal_title=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">

The results show that natural sounds as a group were generally preferred to urban sounds; the preferences of soundscape elements influenced people’s choice of using an urban square; and in terms of sound preference, the differences amongst age groups were rather significant, whereas between males and females only slight differences were found.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychoacoustical evaluation of natural and urban sounds in soundscapes;,citation_abstract=Among various sounds in the environment, natural sounds, such as water sounds and birdsongs, have proven to be highly preferred by humans, but the reasons for these preferences have not been thoroughly researched. This paper explores differences between various natural and urban environmental sounds from the viewpoint of objective measures, especially psychoacoustical parameters. The sound samples used in this study include the recordings of single sound source categories of water, wind, birdsongs, and urban sounds including street music, mechanical sounds, and traffic noise. The samples are analyzed with a number of existing psychoacoustical parameter algorithmic models. Based on hierarchical cluster and principal components analyses of the calculated results, a series of differences has been shown among different sound types in terms of key psychoacoustical parameters. While different sound categories cannot be identified using any single acoustical and psychoacoustical parameter, identification can be made with a group of parameters, as analyzed with artificial neural networks and discriminant functions in this paper. For artificial neural networks, correlations between network predictions and targets using the average and standard deviation data of psychoacoustical parameters as inputs are above 0.95 for the three natural sound categories and above 0.90 for the urban sound category.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Presence of 1/f noise in the temporal structure of psychoacoustic parameters of natural and urban sounds;,citation_abstract=1/f noise or pink noise, which has been shown to be universal in nature, has also been observed in the temporal envelope of music, speech, and environmental sound. Moreover, the slope of the spectral density of the temporal envelope of music has been shown to correlate well to its pleasing, dull, or chaotic character. In this paper, the temporal structure of a number of instantaneous psychoacoustic parameters of environmental sound is examined in order to investigate whether a 1/f temporal structure appears in various types of sound that are generally preferred by people in everyday life. The results show, to some extent, that different categories of environmental sounds have different temporal structure characteristics. Only a number of urban sounds considered and birdsong, generally, exhibit 1/f behavior on short to medium duration time scales, i.e., from 0.1 s to 10 s, in instantaneous loudness and sharpness, whereas a more chaotic variation is found in birdsong at longer time scales, i.e., of 10 s-200 s. The other sound categories considered exhibit random or monotonic variations in the different time scales. In general, this study shows that a 1/f temporal structure is not necessarily present in environmental sounds that are commonly perceived as pleasant.;,citation_author=Ming Yang;,citation_author=Bert De Coensel;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_publication_date=2015-07;,citation_cover_date=2015-07;,citation_year=2015;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.4927033;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_pmid=26328707;,citation_volume=138;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perceptual assessment of indoor water sounds over environmental noise through windows;,citation_abstract=Indoor water sounds were examined in terms of perceptual enhancement of environmental noise through openings for natural ventilation. An experiment was conducted using a simple indoor water fountain system with forty participants (18 women and 22 men) aged between 19 and 27 in an environmental chamber. The indoor water sound levels were varied from 35.8 dBA to 59.8 dBA. Environmental noises transmitted through windows in the living rooms of actual residences were measured and classified into traffic and railway noises and their levels were between 43.0 dBA and 62.1 dBA. The subjective judgment obtained from laboratory experiments showed that the introduction of water sounds resulted in an improvement of environmental noise entering through windows according to water sound level in four psychoacoustical characteristics, where the perception of annoyance reduced and that of pleasantness, calmness and naturalness increased. Pleasantness was the most sensitive characteristic, and noisiness and loudness were the least sensitive characteristics describing the indoor water effects among the six psychoacoustical characteristics used. In terms of gender difference, it was found that women were more perceptive to the introduction of water sounds than men in the parameters of noisiness, loudness and annoyance.;,citation_author=Wonyoung Yang;,citation_author=Hyeun Jun Moon;,citation_author=Myung Jun Kim;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=June 2017;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2018.01.028;,citation_issn=1872-910X;,citation_volume=135;,citation_journal_title=Applied Acoustics;,citation_publisher=Elsevier;">

Sound recordings were taken at various sites in and around a metro station and a listening test applied to investigate whether spaces could be recognized only by the sounds associated with them. For each sound recording, participants were asked to describe the recorded space from 17 adjective pairs and define the sound sources. The results are as follows: (1) only half of the participants were able to correctly determine the function of the spaces; (2) bird, wind, and water soundmarks were identified in the urban park near the metro station; pay gates and coin sounds were identified in the station entrance; and the metro train itself, as well as its brakes, doors, and announcement system, were identified on the underground platform; (3) for outdoor spaces, participants tended to choose adjectives such as pleasant, calming, or natural, while for indoor spaces they chose words such as unpleasant, stressing, and artificial; and (4) females on average are able to identify 30% more sounds correctly than males are, and younger age groups’ correct identification rate is greater than older groups’ by 10% on average.;,citation_author=Semiha Yilmazer;,citation_author=Zeynep Bora;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/1351010X17741742;,citation_issn=2059-8025;,citation_volume=24;,citation_journal_title=Building Acoustics;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of social, demographical and behavioral factors on the sound level evaluation in urban open spaces;,citation_abstract=The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of social, demographical and behavioral factors as well as long-term sound experience on the subjective evaluation of sound level in urban open public spaces. This is based on a series of large scale surveys in 19 urban open spaces in Europe and China. The results suggest that the effects of social/demographical factors, including age, gender, occupation, education and residential status, on the sound level evaluation are generally insignificant, although occupation and education are two related factors and both correlate to the sound level evaluation more than other factors. The effects of some behavioral factors, including wearing earphones, reading/writing and moving activities, are also insignificant on the sound level evaluation, but the watching behavior is highly related to the sound level evaluation. Compared to the social, demographical and behavioral factors, the long-term sound experience, i.e. the acoustic environment at home, significantly affect the sound level evaluation in urban open spaces. It is important to note that between the social/demographical factors, there are generally significant correlations, although the correlation coefficients may not be high. It is also noted that there are considerable variations between different urban open spaces.;,citation_author=Lei Yu;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_publication_date=2008-07;,citation_cover_date=2008-07;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1121/1.2821955;,citation_issn=0001-4966;,citation_pmid=18247882;,citation_volume=123;,citation_journal_title=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Factors influencing the sound preference in urban open spaces;,citation_abstract=In this paper, based on a large scale survey in Europe and China as well as corresponding laboratory studies, the influencing factors on the sound preference evaluation, considering social, demographical, physical, behavioural and psychological facets, have been systematically examined based on statistical analyses for each of the 19 case study sites. Various sound types have been considered, including natural, human, mechanical and instrumental sounds. In terms of social/demographical factors, the results suggest that age and education level are two factors which universally influence the sound preference significantly, although the influence may vary with different types of urban open spaces and sounds. With increasing age or education level, people tend to prefer natural sounds and are more annoyed by mechanical sounds in general. It has also been found that gender, occupation and residence status generally would not influence the sound preference evaluation significantly, although gender has a rather strong influence for certain sound types such as bird sounds, especially at certain case study sites. In terms of physical factors (season, time of day), behavioural factors (frequency of coming to the site, reason for coming to the site), and psychological factors (site preference), generally speaking, their influence on the sound preference evaluation is insignificant, except for limited case study sites and certain sound types. The influence of home sound environment, in terms of sounds heard at home, on the sound preference has been found to be generally insignificant, except for certain sounds. It is noted that there are some correlations between social/demographical factors and the studied physical/behavioural/psychological factors, which should be taken into account when considering the influence of individual factors on sound preference.  2010 Elsevier Ltd.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of soundscape dimensions on acoustic comfort in urban open public spaces;,citation_abstract=Soundscapes in public squares play important roles in urban open spaces. This study aimed to discover the effect of four soundscape dimensions, namely relaxation, communication, spatiality and dynamics, on acoustic comfort in urban open public spaces. A typical city square in China was selected as a case site. Sound environment measurements and questionnaire surveys were carried out for 8 survey positions. The results showed that the perceived dominance of sound sources had a significant effect on relaxation, communication, spatiality and dynamics. Relaxation was greater when the natural sound was perceived dominantly, while it was lower when mechanical sounds or anthropogenic sounds were perceived dominantly. Acoustic comfort had a significant correlation with the soundscape dimensions and LAeq, with spearman’s correlation coefficients of 0.495 (relaxation), 0.210 (sound pressure level) and 0.288 (spatiality). In terms of the differences in perceived sound types, acoustic comfort was positively correlated with relaxation when natural sound or anthropogenic sound was perceived dominantly. As spatiality increased, acoustic comfort first decreased and later increased when relaxation was higher, while there were positive correlations between acoustic comfort and relaxation under the other situations. Moreover, when spatiality or communication was higher, there were significant correlations between acoustic comfort and dynamics. According to these results, acoustic comfort can be increased as soundscape dimensions change in an urban open public space.;,citation_author=Xu Zhang;,citation_author=Meihui Ba;,citation_author=Jian Kang;,citation_author=Qi Meng;,citation_publication_date=2018-04;,citation_cover_date=2018-04;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.apacoust.2017.11.024;,citation_issn=1872-910X;,citation_pmid=27572540;,citation_volume=133;,citation_journal_title=Applied Acoustics;,citation_publisher=Elsevier BV;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Automatic Spatial Audio Scene Classification in Binaural Recordings of Music;,citation_abstract=The aim of the study was to develop a method for automatic classification of the three spatial audio scenes, differing in horizontal distribution of foreground and background audio content around a listener in binaurally rendered recordings of music. For the purpose of the study, audio recordings were synthesized using thirteen sets of binaural-room-impulse-responses (BRIRs), representing room acoustics of both semi-anechoic and reverberant venues. Head movements were not considered in the study. The proposed method was assumption-free with regards to the number and characterstics of the audio sources. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was employed as a classifier. According to the results, it is possible to automatically identify the spatial scenes using a combination of binaural and spectro-temporal features. The method exhibits a satisfactory classification accuracy when it is trained and then tested on different stimuli but synthesized using the same BRIRs (accuracy ranging from 74% to 98%), even in highly reverberant conditions. However, the generalizability of the method needs to be further improved. This study demonstrates that in addition to the binaural cues, the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients constitute an important carrier of spatial information, imperative for the classification of spatial audio scenes.;,citation_author=Slawomir K.

The structural summary method (SSM) was developed to evaluate the interpersonal nature of other constructs and measures outside the interpersonal circumplex. To date, this method has been primarily descriptive, providing no way to draw inferences when comparing SSM parameters across constructs or groups. We describe a newly developed resampling-based method for deriving confidence intervals, which allows for SSM parameter comparisons. In a series of five studies, we evaluated the accuracy of the approach across a wide range of possible sample sizes and parameter values, and demonstrated its utility for posing theoretical questions on the interpersonal nature of relevant constructs (e.g., personality disorders) using real-world data. As a result, the SSM is strengthened for its intended purpose of construct evaluation and theory building.;,citation_author=Johannes Zimmermann;,citation_author=Aidan G. C.

    <p>The soundscape approach provides a basis for considering the holistic perception of sound environments, in context. While steady advancements have been made in methods for assessment and analysis, a gap exists for comparing soundscapes and quantifying improvements in the multi-dimensional perception of a soundscape. To this end, there is a need for the creation of single value indices to compare soundscape quality which incorporate context, aural diversity, and specific design goals. Just as a variety of decibel-based indices have been developed for various purposes (e.g., LAeq, LCeq, L90, Lden, etc.), the soundscape approach requires the ability to create novel indices for different uses, but which share a common language and understanding. We therefore propose a unified framework for creating both bespoke and archetypal single index measures of soundscape perception based on the soundscape circumplex model, allowing for new indices to be defined in the future. The implementation of this framework is demonstrated through the creation of a public space typology-based index using survey data collected under the SSID Protocol. Indices developed under this framework can enable a broader and more efficient application of the soundscape approach in design, planning, and regulation.</p>
